         "Correct answer: A\n\nRationale: Drip irrigation delivers small, precise amounts of water directly to the plant root zone through emitters, minimising evaporation, runoff and deep percolation losses. In Kenya’s arid and semi-arid areas this method can save 40-70 % more water than furrow, basin or sprinkler systems while still maintaining or increasing crop yields. Flood, basin and furrow techniques spread water over a larger soil surface, leading to high evaporation and seepage losses. Overhead sprinklers lose additional water through wind drift and droplet evaporation. Consequently, drip irrigation is universally regarded as the most water-efficient option for smallholders in dry regions.",

         "Correct answer: A\n\nRationale: Drip irrigation delivers small, precise amounts of water directly to the plant root zone through emitters, minimising evaporation, runoff and deep percolation losses. In Kenya’s arid and semi-arid areas this method can save 40-70 % more water than furrow, basin or sprinkler systems while still maintaining or increasing crop yields. Flood, basin and furrow techniques spread water over a larger soil surface, leading to high evaporation and seepage losses. Overhead sprinklers lose additional water through wind drift and droplet evaporation. Consequently, drip irrigation is universally regarded as the most water-efficient option for smallholders in dry regions.",

         "Correct answer: A\n\nRationale: Drip irrigation delivers small, precise amounts of water directly to the plant root zone through emitters, minimising evaporation, runoff and deep percolation losses. In Kenya’s arid and semi-arid areas this method can save 40-70 % more water than furrow, basin or sprinkler systems while still maintaining or increasing crop yields. Flood, basin and furrow techniques spread water over a larger soil surface, leading to high evaporation and seepage losses. Overhead sprinklers lose additional water through wind drift and droplet evaporation. Consequently, drip irrigation is universally regarded as the most water-efficient option for smallholders in dry regions.",

Using only nitrogen (C) ignores crucial nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients, leading to deficiencies and lower yields.

Random application (A) wastes money and can create nutrient imbalances.

         "What are the best practices in the intercropping of legume crops with cereal crops?",
         "Correct answer: B\n\nRationale: Successful cereal–legume intercrops depend on matching species with complementary growth habits, planting them at the right time, and giving each crop enough space so they do not compete excessively for light, nutrients and moisture. Alternating or rotating rows (e.g., 1:1 or 2:1 arrangements) helps each crop access sunlight and soil resources while allowing the legume to fix nitrogen that the cereal can use. Option A is poor practice because overly dense cereals shade out legumes and nullify intercropping benefits. Option C is unnecessary and counter-productive: high nitrogen suppresses legume nodulation and wastes money. Option D reduces yield and seed quality of the legume. Option E encourages build-up of pests, diseases and soil nutrient imbalances; rotations should vary crops across seasons.",

         "Correct answer: C\n\nRationale: Effective weed control in maize relies on using the right herbicide at the correct growth stage. A pre-emergence herbicide applied immediately after planting prevents most weeds from germinating. Any weeds that escape should be controlled with a labeled post-emergence product while they are still small and tender, usually at the 2–4-leaf stage. This approach minimizes crop competition, reduces herbicide resistance risk, and avoids crop injury. Applying herbicide at any stage (A) or on mature weeds (B) lowers effectiveness, while overdosing (D) can damage maize and the environment. Spraying under windy, rainy, or very hot conditions (E) leads to drift, wash-off, or volatilization, wasting product and harming non-target areas.",

         "Which fertilizer is suitable during top-dressing of maize?",
         "Correct answer: C, D\n\nRationale: Top-dressing is the process of applying additional fertilizer to crops during the growing season to provide essential nutrients that promote healthy growth. For maize, nitrogen is a crucial nutrient during top-dressing to encourage vegetative growth. Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) and Urea (C) are commonly used in top-dressing due to their high nitrogen content. Organic fertilizers (D) can also be suitable for top-dressing as they improve soil fertility and provide a range of nutrients, although they may release nutrients more slowly. DAP (A) is typically used at planting time as a starter fertilizer because it contains high levels of phosphorus, which is important for root development. NPK (B) fertilizers, while containing essential nutrients, are not specifically designed for top-dressing and their nutrient ratio may not meet the specific needs during this stage. Muriate of Potash (MOP, E) is primarily a source of potassium and is not typically used for top-dressing maize, which requires a significant nitrogen boost.",

This system supports high milk yields through controlled feeding and improved animal management. Semi-intensive systems can also be suitable since they combine stall feeding with controlled grazing, allowing for some grazing when land is available but still primarily rely on providing supplementary feed.
