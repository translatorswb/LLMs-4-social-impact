Question: What factors affect the price of Guntur Chilli?","1. Quality of Guntur chillies (bright deep-red colour, uniform size and high pungency) is the first thing buyers check.  
2. Moisture content should be around 10–12%; too much or too little moisture lowers your price.  
3. Improved varieties like Guntur Sannam, Teja or Vaibhav usually fetch higher rates than common local types.  
4. Seasonal supply affects prices—when many farmers bring ripe chillies to market at the same time, rates often drop.  
5. Stocks in cold storage and arrivals from other chilli‐growing states also influence mandi prices.  
6. Strong demand from domestic chilli‐powder mills and export buyers (for example Sri Lanka, Bangladesh) pushes prices up.  
7. Transportation, packaging, handling and market (APMC) fees are added costs that can reduce your net price.  
8. Government policies—such as export duties, minimum support price (MSP) and mandi commission charges—affect the price you receive.  
9. Finally, price trends on national commodity exchanges and daily mandi bulletins help set local benchmark rates."

Question: What are alternative crops to cowdung?","Here are some good organic alternatives to cow dung manure:  
1. Vermicompost – made by earthworms breaking down kitchen and farm wastes. It is rich in nutrients and improves soil structure.  
2. Poultry manure – high in nitrogen and fast-acting, but it must be well-composted to avoid burning plants.  
3. Green‐manure crops – such as sun hemp, dhaincha or cowpea; these are grown and plowed back into the soil to add organic matter and nutrients.  
4. Compost – a mix of crop residues, leaves, vegetable peelings and other plant waste fully decomposed; it balances soil nutrients and helps water retention.  
5. Farmyard manure from other animals – goat, sheep or rabbit manure also work well when properly composted.  
6. Biogas slurry – the residue left after biogas production is a balanced, ready-to-use fertilizer.  
7. Neem cake or groundnut cake – oilseed cakes are good sources of nitrogen and also help control soil pests.  

Always ensure any manure is well-decomposed before applying to avoid harming your crops."

Question: What are the effects of marigold as a trap crop?","1. Marigold planted alongside or around your main crop draws pests such as aphids, whiteflies and beetles away from vegetables.  
2. Its roots release a natural chemical (α-terthienyl) that suppresses root-knot nematodes in the soil.  
3. By attracting above-ground pests and reducing below-ground nematodes, marigold lowers overall pest pressure.  
4. Fewer pests mean less crop damage and often higher yields in your cash crop.  
5. Sow marigold in strips or patches at field edges or between rows for best trap-crop effect.  
6. Pull or mow marigolds before they set seed to prevent volunteer plants next season.  
7. This practice is low-cost, chemical-free and fits well into crop rotation on small farms."

Question: Can the quantity of grain be increased in the absence of green fodder?  ","Yes, you can still increase grain yields even if you do not have your own green fodder, but you will need to replace the soil-building and nutrient benefits that green fodder normally provides. 1. Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure, vermicompost or compost at 5–10 tonnes per hectare to build soil organic matter. 2. Grow a short-duration legume green manure (for example, sunn hemp or dhaincha) on fallow land or as an intercrop, then plough it under before flowering. 3. Use biofertilisers such as Rhizobium (for pulses) and Azospirillum (for cereals) to improve nitrogen availability. 4. Follow a balanced fertilizer schedule based on a recent soil test—don’t overuse nitrogen alone; include phosphorus, potassium and sulphur. 5. Add micronutrients (zinc, boron, iron) if your soil test shows deficiencies. 6. Maintain good weed, pest and disease control and ensure adequate irrigation at critical growth stages (tillering, flowering and grain-fill). 7. Finally, choose high-yielding, locally adapted grain varieties and follow recommended spacing and planting time. By combining these practices you can achieve good grain yields even without on-farm green fodder."

Question: How do I to recognize milk fever in cows?  ","Milk fever usually appears in high-yielding cows within 48 hours after calving. At first you may see trembling muscles, shaky walk, restlessness or sensitivity to noise. Next the cow becomes wobbly, holds her neck in an “S” shape, and may lie down in a sternal (stern-up) position but cannot rise easily. If untreated she will slip into full recumbency (lying on her side), become dull, have cold ears and limbs, a dry muzzle, and a slow, weak heartbeat. Body temperature often drops below normal. Early treatment with calcium salts by a veterinarian brings the best recovery."

Question: How do I to choose a suitable breed of cow?  ","1. First decide your main goal: milk, draught power or dual purpose (milk plus work).  
2. Check your climate and farm resources—high-yielding exotic breeds need more good-quality feed and cooler temperatures, while indigenous breeds tolerate heat and low-quality feed better.  
3. If you want high milk yield and can afford more concentrate and good housing, consider crossbreds of Holstein Friesian or Jersey with local cows.  
4. For lower input costs, better disease resistance and heat tolerance, choose Indian breeds like Gir, Sahiwal or Red Sindhi.  
5. Visit your nearest veterinary or livestock development office to see animals and ask about local performance records.  
6. Ask farmers in your area about health problems, milk yield and feed costs they face with different breeds.  
7. Make sure you can provide the recommended vaccination, deworming and regular veterinary check-ups.  
8. Balance your budget: remember higher-yield breeds bring more income but need more investment in feed and care.  
9. Finally, buy from a reliable breeder or government dairy farm to ensure the animal’s pedigree and health certificates."

2. Practice intercropping – for example, sow maize with groundnut or cowpea – to use sunlight and soil nutrients more fully.  
3. Grow cover crops (such as sunn hemp or cowpea) in fallow periods and then plow them in as green manure to boost soil organic matter.  
4. Apply compost or vermicompost made from farm residues and animal dung to feed soil microbes and improve soil structure.  
5. Use reduced or zero tillage and keep crop residues on the field surface as mulch to conserve moisture and prevent erosion.  
6. Introduce agroforestry by planting nitrogen-fixing trees (like Faidherbia albida) along field boundaries for shade, fodder, and leaf litter.  
7. Inoculate seeds with biofertilizers (Rhizobium for legumes, Azotobacter for cereals) to enhance biological nitrogen fixation.  
8. Employ contour bunding or graded furrows on sloping land to slow water runoff and increase water infiltration.  
9. Scout fields regularly and use biocontrol (Trichoderma, neem oil sprays) to manage pests instead of synthetic chemicals."

Question: How do I control yellow pests in paddy fields? ","1. “Yellow stem borer” moths lay eggs on lower leaves; their larvae bore into the stem and cause “dead hearts.”  
2. Transplant your seedlings on time (not earlier than 30 days after sowing) to escape peak borer flight.  
3. After harvest, plough or puddle fields well and bury rice stubbles deeply to destroy overwintering larvae.  
4. Maintain a 5 cm water depth until 45 days after transplanting to drown young borers.  
5. Scout your field weekly: if you see more than 5 % dead hearts, consider control.  
6. Hand-pick and destroy visible egg masses (small yellow patches on leaves).  
7. Release Trichogramma chilonis wasps at 20–25 days after transplanting (100 000–150 000 wasps per hectare in two batches).  
8. Install pheromone traps (5–6 per hectare) at field borders to monitor and reduce moth numbers.  
9. If infestation is heavy, spray a selective insecticide (e.g., Cartap hydrochloride at 75 kg/ha or Chlorantraniliprole at 60 g/ha) when you first see 5 % dead hearts.  
10. Always follow label instructions, respect the pre-harvest interval, and rotate insecticides to prevent resistance."

Question: What is the best fertilizer when planting?","1. The “best” fertilizer at planting depends on your soil’s nutrient levels, so first get a simple soil test from your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra or agricultural office.  
2. For most crops, a balanced starter mix of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) works well—common options are DAP (diammonium phosphate, 18–46–0) or an NPK blend like 12–32–16.  
3. Apply the full dose of phosphorus (from DAP or single super phosphate) and about one-third of the recommended nitrogen at planting.  
4. Mix the fertilizer lightly into the soil around the seed or transplant hole to encourage root uptake.  
5. Keep potassium (muriate of potash, 0–0–60) available in the soil, especially for tuber and fruit crops, and apply it in the basal dose if your soil test shows low K.  
6. Top-dressing (the remaining N) should be split and applied later at critical growth stages (tillering, flowering).  
7. Also add well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost (2–3 t/ha) to improve soil health and moisture retention.  
8. Finally, follow the crop-specific fertilizer schedule from your nearest extension center to match local conditions."

Question: White mold is developing on my mushrooms, what are potential solutions?  ","1. First, confirm it’s not your mushroom mycelium but a competing fungus (often called “cobweb” or green mold stage of Trichoderma).  
2. Stop watering and misting until the air above the beds dries a bit—high humidity and poor airflow encourage mold.  
3. Improve ventilation by increasing fresh air exchange or using a small fan to keep air moving above the crop.  
4. Remove and safely dispose of any heavily infected mushrooms and substrate to stop further spread.  
5. Lightly spray affected areas with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (1 part 3% H₂O₂ to 4 parts water) to kill mold spores.  
6. Check and lower your casing layer moisture; it should feel damp but not wet or soggy.  
7. Sterilize or discard old casing soil and tools, then always work with clean hands or gloves to prevent re-contamination.  
8. Finally, use fresh, high-quality spawn from a reputable supplier to reduce the chance of introducing contaminants next time."

Question: How many types of onions are there and what are there benefits?  ","There are three main types of onions:  
1. Bulb onions (full-size “storage” onions in yellow, red or white varieties)  
2. Green onions (scallions or spring onions)  
3. Shallots  

Bulb onions:  
• Yellow bulbs store longest and have a strong, pungent flavor for cooking.  
• Red bulbs are milder and sweeter, rich in antioxidants—great for salads, chutneys and pickles.  
• White bulbs have the mildest taste, ideal in sauces, snacks and fresh salsas.  

Green onions mature in 30–40 days, give both tender white stems and leafy greens, are rich in vitamins and fetch quick returns.  
Shallots form clusters of small, sweet, aromatic bulbs that command premium prices for curries, pickles and gourmet markets."

Question: How do I manage water in rice cultivation?  ","1. First, level your field well and build good bunds so water spreads evenly and does not leak away.  
2. After transplanting, keep about 3–5 cm of standing water to help young plants tiller.  
3. From about 15 days after transplanting until just before flowering, use Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD): let the field surface start to crack or the soil feel dry 2 cm below the surface, then re-flood to 3–5 cm.  
4. AWD saves up to 30 % of irrigation water and reduces methane emissions without cutting yield.  
5. Fix any leaks in canals or bunds, and close field inlets quickly when water is enough.  
6. At panicle initiation stop reflooding and begin a final drain 1–2 weeks before harvest to harden grains and ease harvesting.  
7. Check moisture by pushing a stick or your finger 10–15 cm into the soil; if it’s dry, it’s time to irrigate again."

Question: What type of beans should I plant?","1. The “best” bean depends on your climate, soil and market demand.  
2. For a short-duration, heat-tolerant pulse in kharif, green gram (moong) matures in 50–60 days and fits well into rice‐wheat rotations.  
3. Black gram (urad) also thrives in similar conditions and can tolerate slightly heavier soils.  
4. If you have very low rainfall, cluster bean (guar) or cowpea (lobia) are drought-tolerant options.  
5. In rabi season, French bean (garden bean) and kidney bean (rajmash) do well in cooler, well-drained soils.  
6. French bean seeds come in green or purple pods and fetch good prices in nearby markets.  
7. Rajmash grows on light to medium soils and can be sold as dried grain.

Question: What precautions should farmers take to prevent waterlogging?","1. Level your field and shape bunds so there are no low spots where water can pool.  
2. Make raised beds or ridges so crop roots stay above any standing water.  
3. Dig small drains or trenches along the field edges (or install tile pipes) to carry excess water away.  
4. Keep bund outlets open and clear of soil or vegetation so water can flow out freely.  
5. Irrigate only when soil is dry—do not apply water if the soil is already wet.  
6. Break any hardpan by deep plowing or subsoiling to help rainwater soak in.  
7. Add organic matter (compost or farmyard manure) to improve soil structure and drainage.  
8. Rotate sensitive crops with deep‐rooted or water‐tolerant varieties to maintain good soil porosity.  
9. Monitor weather forecasts and stop irrigation before heavy rains to avoid excess water."

Question: What causes dandruff in onions?  ","Dandruff in onions shows up as small, superficial brown flakes on the outer bulb scales. It is not a fungal disease but a physiological disorder caused by rapid changes in moisture and temperature—especially high heat and low humidity—when skins are forming. Irregular irrigation during bulb swelling can weaken skin layers so they crack and flake. Exposed scales that get sunburn or are bruised during handling also start to peel. Bulbs left too long in the field under hot, dry conditions are most at risk. To prevent it, keep soil moisture even, avoid mid-day irrigation shocks, and harvest once necks are dry but before extreme heat. Cure bulbs in a well-ventilated, moderate-temperature (25–30 °C) area rather than in direct sun. Gentle handling to avoid scale damage will further reduce dandruff. Although it spoils appearance, the edible part inside remains unaffected."
