Question: I have been applying different pesticides to control pests on my farm. However, they seem not to be effective, what can I do?","1. First make sure you have correctly identified the pest; if unsure, take a sample to your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra or extension officer.  
2. Use a pesticide that is specifically recommended for that pest and avoid repeating the same chemical family—pests quickly become resistant when the active ingredient never changes.  
3. After each spray, rotate to a product with a different IRAC or FRAC group number and leave at least 10–14 days before using the same group again.  
4. Calibrate your knapsack sprayer so the recommended dose of chemical and the right volume of water reach every part of the crop; under- or over-dilution both reduce effectiveness.  
5. Mix the spray in clean, soft water; hard or muddy water binds many pesticides and makes them weak.  
6. Spray early morning or late afternoon when the air is calm and the pest is active; wind and hot midday sun cause drift and rapid evaporation.  
7. Add a sticker–spreader (about 1 ml per litre) so the spray forms an even film on the leaves, especially against sucking insects.  
8. Combine chemicals with cultural and biological methods: rogue and destroy heavily infested plants, use yellow or blue sticky traps, release Trichogramma cards, and sow pest-tolerant varieties.  
9. Keep a notebook of spray date, product name, group number, dose and result; these records help you and the extension worker fine-tune your program and avoid resistance."

Question: I have been losing my crops and livestock due to drought and floods. What can I do to get compensation during such occurrences?","1. The main way to receive compensation for crop losses due to droughts or floods is to enrol your fields in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the central government’s crop-insurance scheme.  
2. You can sign up at your nearest bank, Primary Agricultural Credit Society, Common Service Centre, or through the PMFBY mobile app before the cut-off date for each season (usually 15–31 days before sowing).  
3. Pay only 2 % of the sum insured for Kharif crops, 1.5 % for Rabi crops and 5 % for commercial/horticulture crops; the balance premium is paid by the government.  
4. If a drought or flood damages your standing crop, inform the insurance company, bank or agriculture officer within 72 hours—delayed intimation can cancel the claim.  
5. Keep evidence: geo-tagged photos, Panchayat/Patwari loss report, seed purchase bills and field-book entries; these help the assessor calculate your loss quickly.  
6. For livestock, enrol animals under the Livestock Insurance Scheme run by the Department of Animal Husbandry; premiums are 30–50 % subsidised for up to two milch animals per family.  
7. In case an insured animal dies due to a calamity, get a post-mortem certificate from the local veterinarian and submit the claim form to the insurance company within 7 days.  
8. When a calamity is officially declared by the district administration, you can also seek immediate relief from the State Disaster Response Fund through your Gram Panchayat or Tehsildar; this is separate from insurance but usually smaller.  
9. Finally, keep your land records (7/12 extract or Pahani), Aadhaar card and bank passbook updated, because all compensation and insurance payments are transferred directly to your bank account under DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer)."

Question: I am interested in learning about crops and livestock production. Where can I visit to learn more about crops and livestock production?","1. Start with the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in your district; they give free, hands-on training, have demo crop plots and keep small dairy, goat and poultry units you can observe.  
2. Visit the nearest State Agricultural University campus or its regional research station, which keeps model fields and livestock farms and offers farmer exposure visits on request.  
3. ICAR institutes—like IARI, New Delhi (crops), IVRI, Izatnagar (animal health), NDRI, Karnal (dairy) and CIBA, Chennai (fish)—run short farmer courses and open days throughout the year.  
4. Your District Agriculture Training Centre or Farm Information & Advisory Centre, run by the state agriculture department, holds low-cost practical classes on both crops and animals.  
5. Government livestock farms under the Department of Animal Husbandry allow farmers to watch best management practices and buy improved calves, chicks or kids.  
6. Attend seasonal Kisan Melas and Agri-Tech Fairs organised by SAUs and ICAR; you can see new varieties, machinery demonstrations and live animal displays in one place.  
7. Ask the ATMA (Agricultural Technology Management Agency) office at block level to put you on study tours to progressive farmers’ fields or commercial dairy and poultry units nearby.  
8. For addresses, dates and phone numbers of all these centres, call the toll-free Kisan Call Centre 1800-180-1551 or check the mKisan and Kisan Suvidha mobile apps."

Question: Which bean variety is suitable for dryland agro-ecological zone?","For dryland conditions, use the French bean (vegetable bean) variety “Contender.”  
It has a deep root system and tolerates short drought spells better than most other varieties.  
The crop comes to first picking in about 45–50 days, so it escapes late-season moisture stress.  
Pods are 12–14 cm long, fleshy and string-less, fetching a good market price.  
Under rain-fed management you can expect 4–5 tonnes of green pods per hectare.  
Sow with the first dependable rains at 45 cm row spacing and 10 cm between plants, using about 50 kg seed/ha.  
Incorporate 5 t FYM plus a basal dose of 20 : 50 : 25 kg N : P₂O₅ : K₂O per hectare; give another 20 kg N at flowering if soil moisture permits.  
Keep the field weed-free for the first 30 days and mulch with crop residue to conserve moisture.  
The variety is moderately resistant to mosaic and rust; if disease appears, spray neem extract or a triazole fungicide.  
Harvest pods every 3–4 days at pencil thickness to maintain quality and encourage continuous flowering."

Question: If I am unable to acquire certified maize seeds, which variety can I save and replant the next season?","Choose an open-pollinated composite (OPV) maize variety, not a hybrid, because OPVs breed “true to type” and will still give you good yield when their seed is saved for the next season. Popular Indian OPVs you can save include Suwan-1, Shakti, Vijay Composite, Jawahar Maize-15 (JM-15) and Vivek QPM-9; ask your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra which one suits your agro-climatic zone. During harvest select the healthiest, well-filled, disease-free cobs from plants in the middle of the field, because these are least affected by border pollen contamination. Dry the selected cobs to 12–13 % moisture (the kernels should bite hard and fall clean) and store them unshelled in a cool, dry, rodent-free place or shell and keep in airtight bags after treating with fungicide/insecticide dust (e.g., thiram + carbaryl 5 g kg⁻¹ seed). Keep at least 200 m isolation distance from other maize or sorghum fields at flowering time next season to maintain purity. Do not replant single-cross, double-cross or QPM hybrids such as HQPM-1, HQPM-5, P3396, etc., because their F₂ seed segregates and yields can drop 25–40 %. Test germination one month before sowing; if less than 85 %, increase seed rate or obtain fresh seed. Use a seed rate of 20–25 kg ha⁻¹ for bold-kernel OPVs, treat with Azospirillum + Trichoderma if available, and plant at 60 cm × 20 cm spacing. Follow recommended fertilizer (about 100:50:50 kg NPK ha⁻¹ split 3 times) and timely weed control to realize the genetic potential of the saved seed."

Question: Are chemical pesticides important and safe in crop and livestock production?","Yes, chemical pesticides can be useful tools for protecting crops and livestock, but their benefits and safety depend entirely on correct selection and careful use. They quickly reduce pest or disease pressure and can prevent large yield or animal-health losses when no other method works in time. However, the same chemicals can harm people, animals, beneficial insects, soil life and water if you choose the wrong product, use the wrong dose, apply at the wrong stage, or ignore safety rules.  

Follow these basics: (1) Identify the pest accurately and use a pesticide that is officially recommended for that problem; (2) Read the label, measure the dose exactly, and apply only when pest numbers reach the economic-threshold level; (3) Wear gloves, mask, long sleeves and wash afterwards; (4) Keep children, livestock, bee boxes and fish ponds away while spraying; (5) Respect the pre-harvest interval for crops and the drug-withdrawal period for livestock products; (6) Rotate pesticide groups to slow resistance; and (7) Store leftovers in a locked, labeled place, never in food or water containers.  

Combine chemicals with other practices—clean seed, resistant varieties, crop rotation, natural predators, good sanitation—so that you spray less often (Integrated Pest Management). Used this way, modern pesticides are both important and reasonably safe; misused, they are expensive and dangerous."

Question: How can I know that my soil is fertile?","1. The surest way to judge fertility is to send a soil sample to your local soil-testing laboratory; the report tells you the levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), organic matter, pH and any micronutrient shortages.  
2. If the lab says your soil has medium to high N (0.3–0.5%), available P above 10 kg/acre and available K above 120 kg/acre, with pH between 6.5 and 7.5, it is considered fertile for most crops.  
3. Observe your crops: uniform dark-green leaves, good stem thickness, and steady, vigorous growth without extra fertiliser are signs the soil is supplying enough nutrients.  
4. Check previous harvests; if you consistently get yields close to the district average or better, your soil is likely fertile.  
5. Dig a small pit: soil that is crumbly, smells earthy, and shows 3–4 earthworms in a spadeful usually has good organic matter and biological activity, both indicators of fertility.  
6. After heavy rain, fertile soil drains well but still stays moist—standing water or very hard, cracked surfaces suggest problems.  
7. Look for a diverse mix of weeds and small insects; overly sparse or single-species weed growth can mean nutrient imbalance.  
8. Keep records of how much fertiliser you apply versus yield; if yields stay high with modest inputs, the underlying fertility is good.  
9. Repeat a lab test every 2–3 years to track changes and adjust manure or fertiliser use.  
10. If tests or field signs show deficiencies, add well-decomposed farmyard manure, compost, green manures or specific fertilisers as recommended to rebuild soil fertility."

Question: How can I best control weeds in my farm?","1. Start with clean seed and a well-prepared, level field so that weeds emerge uniformly and can be tackled together.  
2. Use line sowing or wider row spacing so you can run a wheel hoe or khurpi between rows 15–20 days after sowing and again at 35–40 days.  
3. Keep soil covered: sow a short-duration green-manure crop in the off-season or spread 5–7 t/acre of crop residue/straw mulch to block light and stop many weed seeds from sprouting.  
4. Maintain good crop density and apply the right basal fertiliser; a vigorous crop shades the soil and suppresses weeds naturally.  
5. Rotate crops (e.g., cereals → pulses → oilseeds) so that the same weed species are not favoured year after year.  
6. If irrigation is available, give a light pre-sowing irrigation (“rauni”) to germinate weed seeds, then do a shallow tillage to kill them before you plant.  
7. For most cereals, spraying Pendimethalin 30 EC at 1 L/acre within 24 hours of sowing (pre-emergence) in 200 L water prevents new weeds from coming up.  
8. In pulses and vegetables, if broad-leaf weeds escape later, a post-emergence spray of Imazethapyr 10 SL at 200 mL/acre or quizalofop-P 5 EC at 400 mL/acre (for grasses) can be used when the crop is 2–3 leaves old.  
9. Always calibrate your knapsack sprayer, use a flat-fan nozzle, and keep the spray boom 50 cm above ground to avoid patchy control and crop injury.  
10. Finally, remove any weeds that survive before they set seed, compost them away from the field, and change herbicide groups every season to prevent resistance."

Question: How do organic and synthetic/inorganic fertilizers compare in terms of effectiveness to crop production, and which one would be more suitable for different farming conditions?","1. Organic sources like farmyard manure, compost, poultry litter and green manure improve soil structure, water-holding and microbial life, but they contain low nutrient percentages (e.g., FYM ≈ 0.5% N) and release them slowly.  
2. Because of this slow, steady release they suit rain-fed fields, light soils prone to erosion, horticulture crops that need good tilth, and farms where plenty of crop residues or animal dung is already available.  
3. Inorganic (synthetic) fertilizers such as urea, DAP, SSP or MOP carry very concentrated nutrients (e.g., urea 46 % N) that become available to the crop within days, giving a quick yield response, especially in high-yielding hybrids under irrigation.  
4. They are therefore vital when soil tests show acute N, P or K deficiency, or when the farmer wants high output from a small area in a short season.  
5. However, repeated use of only synthetics can harden the soil, reduce organic matter, increase acidity or salinity, and raise input costs.  
6. Exclusively organic nutrition usually cannot meet the full NPK demand of cereals like paddy or maize on time, and transporting 5–10 t/acre of manure is costly.  
7. The most practical approach in most Indian smallholdings is “Integrated Nutrient Management”: apply 25–50 % of nutrient needs through compost/FYM/green manure to keep the soil healthy, and supply the remaining deficit with well-timed, right-dose inorganic fertilizers based on soil test results.  
8. Place urea in two or three splits, mix SSP/DAP at sowing, and add MOP before flowering; meanwhile incorporate compost or crop residues after harvest to rebuild organic matter.  
9. Under organic-certified farming or where market premium exists, rely mainly on manures, vermicompost, biofertilizers and legume rotations, but expect slightly lower yields for the first 2–3 years.  
10. In summary, use organics for long-term soil fertility and moisture benefits, synthetics for immediate nutrient needs and higher yields, and blend both according to your soil test, water availability and labour resources."

Question: Lately, the onset of rains has shown significant variability from season to season. This has affected our ability to judge when to plant. In this scenario, when is the best time to plant?","1. Instead of fixing a calendar date, wait to sow until your field has received at least 30–40 mm of effective rain (or an irrigation) within 3–4 consecutive days, so that the top 15 cm of soil is fully moist.  
2. Check the IMD’s 5-day and 15-day district forecasts each evening; if they predict another 20 mm or more within the next week, you can safely go ahead with sowing.  
3. If forecasts show only scattered, light showers (<15 mm), hold seed and keep land prepared—sowing into half-wet soil leads to poor germination and patchy stands.  
4. Where you have access to water, a pre-sowing “life-saving” irrigation can substitute for the first rain and let you plant 7–10 days earlier.  
5. If rains are delayed beyond the normal window, switch to the short-duration or drought-tolerant varieties recommended by your KVK (e.g., 90-day pearl millet instead of 110-day, or early-maturing soybean).  
6. For very erratic areas, split your seed: dry-sow 25–30 % of the area just before a high-confidence rain forecast, and plant the rest only after actual rainfall, reducing total risk.  
7. Always treat and “prime” seed (soak 6–8 hours, shade-dry) before sowing; primed seed emerges 1–2 days faster and copes better if the next shower is late.  
8. Finish sowing within 7–10 days of the first effective rainfall to capture the full growing season and avoid terminal drought at maturity.  
9. Keep simple records of rain dates, soil moisture, and yield each year; after 2–3 seasons you will have your own reliable local guide for the best planting window."

Question: What are the signs of nutrient deficiency in maize and how can they be corrected?","1. Nitrogen lack shows as pale-green to yellow older leaves and slow growth; side-dress 40–50 kg urea/acre at knee-high stage and keep the field moist.  
2. Phosphorus lack gives a purple or reddish colour on older leaves and stunted roots; mix 40–50 kg DAP or 75–100 kg SSP/acre into the soil at sowing.  
3. Potassium lack causes yellow-brown burning along the edges of lower leaves and weak, lodging stalks; apply 25–30 kg MOP (muriate of potash) or 100 kg wood ash/acre before tasselling.  
4. Zinc lack appears as white-yellow bands on the young leaves starting from the mid-rib with shortened plants; add 10 kg zinc sulphate/acre to the soil or spray 0.5 % zinc sulphate + 0.25 % lime on the foliage.  
5. Sulphur lack gives uniform yellowing of the youngest leaves and thin stems; broadcast 40 kg gypsum or use SSP instead of DAP at planting.  
6. Magnesium lack shows as yellowing between the veins of older leaves; treat with 20 kg magnesium sulphate/acre or apply dolomitic lime if soil is acidic.  
7. Iron lack causes the youngest leaves to turn yellow while veins stay green; correct by spraying 1 % ferrous sulphate + 0.5 % lime twice at 10-day intervals.  
8. Keep soil pH around 6–7.5, return crop residues, and add 2–4 t well-decomposed FYM/acre to improve nutrient supply and prevent most deficiencies."

Question: How can I mitigate post-harvest losses in crops and livestock?","1. Harvest at the right maturity in the cool morning or late afternoon, cut gently, and avoid dropping produce to reduce bruises and heat build-up.  
2. Remove “field heat” quickly: keep fruits and vegetables in shade, spread thinly, or dip in cool clean water and drain before packing.  
3. Sort out damaged pieces and pack only sound produce in ventilated plastic crates or baskets lined with leaves—never over-fill gunny bags that crush produce.  
4. Dry food grains to 12–13 % moisture on clean tarpaulins, then store them in airtight metal bins, Pusa kothar, or triple-layer hermetic bags with a handful of dried neem leaves or an approved phosphine tablet to stop insects.  
5. Raise stores 30 cm off the floor, fit rat guards on posts, keep roofs leak-free, and inspect sacks or bins every month for pests.  
6. For perishables, build a zero-energy cool chamber (double brick wall filled with moist sand) or use a small solar/ICE powered walk-in cooler to keep temperature 10–15 °C lower and double shelf life.  
7. Process or add value to surplus: sun-dry chillies and onions, make pickles, pulp, or jam from mango and tomato, or pool produce through an FPO for collective grading, packing, and faster marketing.  
8. For milk, wash the udder and hands, milk into a covered stainless-steel can, strain, and cool below 4 °C within two hours using an ice-water bath or village bulk milk chiller.  
9. For meat, slaughter on a clean platform, remove intestines quickly, wash with potable water, and hang the carcass in shade or a cool room; sell, chill, or freeze the same day.  
10. Keep simple records, clean equipment after every use, and remember: quick cooling or drying, hygienic handling, pest-proof storage, and regular checks together cut post-harvest losses by 30–50 %."

Question: What are some of the strategies that I can employ to manage climate change in crop production?","1. Select short-duration or drought/heat-tolerant varieties recommended by your Krishi Vigyan Kendra (e.g., pearl millet 86M86, rice Sahbhagi Dhan) so the crop can finish before extreme weather strikes.  
2. Shift sowing dates using IMD or DAMU weather forecasts—plant a little earlier in years with likely late monsoon, or a little later if very heavy early rains are predicted.  
3. Diversify: intercrop or rotate cereals with pulses/oilseeds (such as pigeon-pea + sorghum or wheat after mungbean) to spread risk and improve soil fertility.  
4. Conserve water through mulching with crop residues, broad-bed furrow or zero tillage, and, where possible, adopt drip or sprinkler and store rainwater in a farm pond.  
5. Add plenty of organic matter—compost, FYM, green manure or crop residues—to increase soil water-holding capacity, reduce temperature swings, and keep microbes active.  
6. Plant shelterbelts or border rows of neem, gliricidia or subabul to cut hot winds, reduce evaporation, and supply fuel, fodder or green manure.  
7. Follow agromet advisories for timing irrigation, fertilizer and pesticide sprays, so inputs are not lost to unseasonal rain or heat.  
8. Scout fields weekly and practice integrated pest management; warmer, erratic weather often triggers outbreaks of fall armyworm, whitefly or sucking pests.  
9. Enroll in PMFBY crop insurance and use climate-smart credit schemes or FPOs to soften income shocks from drought, flood or hail.  
10. Form village groups to save seed of hardy local varieties and stock dry fodder, so you have planting material and livestock feed ready after extreme events."

Question: What are the best disease management practices in livestock production?","1. Buy animals only from trusted sources and keep any new or sick stock in a separate pen for at least 14 days before mixing with the main herd or flock.  
2. Clean sheds every day, remove dung, change wet bedding, and spray or white-wash walls and floors with lime or phenyl once a month.  
3. Give balanced rations, minerals, and plenty of clean water; well-fed animals fight infections better.  
4. Vaccinate on schedule for your area: cattle/buffalo for FMD, HS and BQ; goats/sheep for PPR and ET; poultry for Ranikhet and IBD—mark the dates in a notebook.  
5. Deworm cattle, goats and sheep every 4–6 months and control ticks, lice, flies and mosquitoes with approved sprays or neem-based solutions.  
6. Burn or bury dead animals in a 6-foot pit with lime to prevent scavengers and disease spread.  
7. Never share needles, dehorners or castration tools without first boiling or disinfecting them in spirit.  
8. Watch animals daily; if you notice fever, coughing, diarrhoea, wounds or sudden drop in milk/egg yield, isolate the animal and call a veterinarian at once.  
9. Keep simple records of births, treatments and deaths—patterns in the book help diagnose problems early.  
10. When all farmers in the village follow these steps together, overall disease pressure falls, medicine costs drop and profits rise."

Question: How are Farmer groups, Farmer Producer Organizations, Community Based Organizations and cooperatives important to farmers?","1. When many small farmers join together in a farmer group, FPO, CBO or cooperative, they can pool their harvest and sell in bulk, which usually brings 5-15 % higher prices than selling individually to a trader.  
2. Buying seed, fertiliser, pesticides or machinery as a group lets you place large orders and get wholesale rates, so your input costs fall.  
3. Banks, NABARD and government schemes prefer to lend to organised groups; therefore you can obtain cheaper credit and crop insurance that is hard to access as a single farmer.  
4. These organisations often arrange training on improved varieties, soil testing, IPM and post-harvest handling, so members keep up with the latest agronomic practices.  
5. By sharing equipment such as tractors, rotavators, threshers or dryers through a cooperative, each member avoids the high cost of individual ownership.  
6. Groups can set up small processing units (dal mill, oil expeller, grading / packing centre) that add value and allow produce to be sold directly to retail chains or e-markets.  
7. Collective bargaining gives you a stronger voice with input suppliers, mandi agents and government departments, helping resolve payment delays and influencing supportive policies.  
8. Finally, working together builds social support: members help each other during planting, harvest or emergencies, reducing individual risk and labour shortages."
