Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: A

Rationale: Option A outlines the comprehensive best practices for transplanting seedlings. Preparing the seedbed to a fine tilth and transplanting seedlings at the appropriate stage are fundamental principles that ensure healthy plant growth. Hardening the seedlings by removing excess shade and reducing watering prepares them for the environmental changes they will face when transplanted. Ensuring the nursery is well-irrigated on the day of transplanting simplifies seedling removal and minimizes root damage. Transplanting onto a well-irrigated seed bed helps establish seedlings in their new environment. Lastly, transplanting in the late evening when temperatures are cooler reduces water loss and transplant shock, leading to better seedling survival. These practices collectively ensure successful transplantation and establishment of seedlings.",A
