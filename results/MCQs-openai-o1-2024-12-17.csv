Question: What are the ways of controlling fall armyworm infestation?

Answer options:
A. Spray fungicide
B. Remove attacked crops
C. Spray FAW pesticides early or late in the day in the maize whorl
D. Spraying with crude plant extracts
E. Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers to boost plant growth

Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: [B, C, D]

Rationale: Fungicides target fungal diseases and are ineffective against the fall armyworm. Removing heavily attacked plant parts helps reduce the worm population by eliminating feeding and breeding sites. Spraying recommended pesticides early or late in the day ensures contact with the worms when they are most active in the maize whorl. Crude plant extracts (e.g., neem) can serve as botanical insecticides against fall armyworms. Applying extra nitrogen mainly promotes plant growth but does not directly control fall armyworm infestations.",C,Fall armyworm (FAW) is a destructive pest that primarily attacks maize and other cereal crops. The most effective method to control FAW is to apply registered pesticides early in the morning or late in the evening when the larvae are actively feeding in the maize whorl. Applying in the whorl increases the contact of the pest with the insecticides.

Question: Which fertilizer application method is more effective for rainfed crops?

Answer options:
A. Broadcasting
B. Fertigation
C. Foliar application
D. Banding around the crop
E. Deep Placement in the soil

Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: D, E

Rationale: Banding places nutrients close to the plant’s roots, increasing uptake efficiency and reducing losses from runoff. Deep placement also minimizes nutrient losses, especially nitrogen, by lowering the chance of volatilization and leaching. Both methods allow the fertilizer to be more effectively used by the crop during unpredictable rainfall patterns. Broadcasting is less efficient because nutrients can be washed away or evaporate. Fertigation requires irrigation systems, which are not typical in purely rainfed conditions. Foliar application is mostly for micronutrients or emergency correction and does not replace root-based nutrient supply.",D,"The most effective fertilizer application method for rainfed crops is banding around the crop because it ensures nutrients are placed close to the root zone, reducing nutrient loss and improving uptake efficiency"

Question: Which fertilizer is suitable during top-dressing of maize?

Answer options:
A. DAP
B. NPK
C. CAN, UREA
D. Organic fertilizer
E. MOP

Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: C

Rationale: Top-dressing of maize requires a readily available source of nitrogen for vegetative growth. CAN and Urea supply adequate nitrogen, allowing for vigorous plant development. DAP is typically used at planting for its high phosphorus content. NPK can be used as basal or specific top-dressing if soil tests show other nutrient deficiencies. MOP is primarily a potassium fertilizer suitable for crops requiring additional potassium. While organic fertilizer boosts soil fertility, it releases nutrients too slowly for an immediate top-dressing effect. Therefore, among the given options, CAN and Urea are most suitable for maize top-dressing.",C,"During top dressing, maize requires fertilizers that are rich in nitrogen, which is essential for vegetative growth. CAN and UREA are the best choices for top-dressing maize. However, they should be applied properly to avoid losses through leaching and volatilization"

B. Break pest, disease and weed cycle
C. Improve soil properties and rainwater penetration
D. Leads to continuous use of the same nutrients
E. Improved biodiversity

Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: [D]

Rationale: Crop rotation involves growing different crops in succession, which helps diversify nutrient use rather than continuously exploiting the same set of nutrients. It also prevents pests, diseases, and weeds from thriving year-round in the same field. Through varying root structures, it improves soil properties such as aeration and infiltration. It maintains or even increases soil fertility and enhances biodiversity by supporting various organisms. Thus, option D is not a benefit of crop rotation.",D,"Crop rotation does not lead to continuous use of the same nutrients. However, it prevents nutrient depletion through alternating crops with varying nutrient requirements thus creating soil fertility balance"

Question: Which dairy production system is suitable in high potential and densely populated areas?

Answer options:
A. Open grazing
B.Intensive (stall feeding/zero grazing)
C. Semi intensive
D. Free-range grazing
E. Nomadic pastoralism


Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: B

Rationale: This system is preferred where land sizes are small and the population is high. Stall feeding saves on space while allowing farmers to manage feeding easily and ensure the animals get balanced rations. It also minimizes the incidence of diseases and parasites compared to open grazing. With zero grazing, farmers can grow or purchase fodder and efficiently use available land for forage production. This intensified approach improves milk output per cow because feed quality is more controlled.",B,"In high-potential and densely populated areas, land resource limited making intensive (stall feeding/zero grazing) the most suitable dairy production system because this system allows farmers to maximize milk production by confining cows in a well-managed space where they are provided with high-quality feed, water, and veterinary care. Unlike open grazing, free-range grazing, or nomadic pastoralism, which require large land areas."
