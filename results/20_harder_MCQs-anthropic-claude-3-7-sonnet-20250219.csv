Rationale: Option A contains all the essential best practices for successful transplanting. Preparing the seedbed to fine tilth creates an optimal environment for new roots. Transplanting at the right stage is critical as seedlings that are too young or too old have poor survival rates. Hardening seedlings by reducing shade and water helps them adapt to field conditions, reducing transplant shock. Irrigating the nursery before transplanting prevents root damage during removal. Transplanting onto well-irrigated soil and handling roots carefully maintains root integrity. Evening transplanting is optimal as cooler temperatures reduce moisture loss and transplant stress. Options B, C, and D each contain at least one incorrect practice: transplanting at any time of day (B), skipping hardening (C), or transplanting at any growth stage (D).",A
