Question: What is the right procedure to harvest onions?

Answer options:
A. Harvest during the dry season, at about 90-150 after planting depending on the variety. The crop must be mature by observing that the tops have started to yellow or droop, and the bulbs will have formed shing membranous cover around them. To harvest, loosen the soil around the plants to allow for easier removal. Pull the bulbs by hand or dig them up with garden fork. Once the bulbs are out of the ground, cut the tops back to about one inch. Clean the bulbs and let them dry in the sun to cure (dry out) before storing. If long storage is intended, cure the bulbs in a well-ventilated store by spreading on racks until the necks and outer scale leaves of the bulbs are thoroughly dried.
B. Harvest during the wet season, at about 90-150 after planting depending on the variety. The crop must be mature by observing that the tops have started to yellow or droop, and the bulbs will have formed shing membranous cover around them. To harvest, loosen the soil around the plants to allow for easier removal. Pull the bulbs by hand or dig them up with garden fork. Once the bulbs are out of the ground, cut the tops back to about one inch. Clean the bulbs and let them dry in the sun to cure (dry out) before storing. If long storage is intended, cure the bulbs in a well-ventilated store by spreading on racks until the necks and outer scale leaves of the bulbs are thoroughly dried.

Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: A

Rationale: Onions should be harvested during the dry season to prevent rot and ensure proper curing, as wet conditions can lead to spoilage—especially relevant in Kenya with its distinct wet seasons. Maturity must be confirmed by visual cues like yellowing or drooping tops and papery bulb covers, not just days after planting (90-150 days is a guideline, but varietal and environmental factors matter). Option A correctly includes all steps: loosening soil, careful hand or fork harvesting, cutting tops to ~1 inch to prevent moisture entry, cleaning, sun-curing, and ventilated storage for longevity. Option B is incorrect due to wet-season harvesting. Option C omits cutting tops, risking rot. Option D misses maturity checks, which could lead to premature or late harvesting. Thus, only A provides the complete, accurate procedure.",A

D. Put on gloves, then a face shield, followed by overall/coveralls, and finally a mask.

Your response must follow this format exactly:

Correct answer: [OPTION(S)]

Rationale: [Not longer than 10 sentences]","Correct answer: C

Rationale: Option C provides the correct sequence for wearing PPE when handling pesticides, as it minimizes contamination risk by starting with coveralls to protect the body, followed by gumboots for foot protection, then a mask for respiratory safety before gloves to avoid face contamination, and ending with a face shield for eye protection. This order aligns with standard agricultural safety guidelines from organizations like WHO and FAO. Option A is incorrect because gloves are worn before the mask, which could lead to respiratory contamination if gloves touch the mask. Option B is unsafe as it starts with the mask, risking displacement when putting on coveralls, and places gloves before coveralls. Option D is flawed because gloves are worn first, exposing hands to early contamination, and coveralls are worn last, leaving the body unprotected during donning. Only C ensures comprehensive protection for farmers during pesticide handling, storage, transport, or spraying.",C
