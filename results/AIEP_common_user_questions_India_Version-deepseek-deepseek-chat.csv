Question: How can I plant mushrooms?","To plant mushrooms, start by choosing a suitable variety like oyster or button mushrooms. Prepare a growing medium—straw, sawdust, or compost—and sterilize it to kill harmful microbes. Purchase mushroom spawn (seeds) from a reliable supplier. Mix the spawn into the moist growing medium and pack it into bags or trays. Keep the setup in a dark, humid place (around 20–25°C). Lightly mist with water daily to maintain moisture. In 2–3 weeks, white mycelium (thread-like growth) will appear. After full colonization, expose the bags to indirect light and fresh air to trigger fruiting. Harvest mushrooms when caps are fully open but before they flatten. Repeat the process with fresh spawn for continuous yield."
