Question: What are the effects of marigold as a trap crop?","Marigold acts as a trap crop by attracting pests like aphids, thrips, and whiteflies away from your main crops (e.g., tomatoes, kale). Its strong scent confuses pests, masking the smell of neighboring plants. When planted around fields or between rows, marigolds lure insects to feed on them instead, reducing damage to your cash crops. Marigolds also suppress root-knot nematodes in soil through natural chemicals in their roots. Remove infested marigold plants regularly to destroy trapped pests and prevent them from spreading. This method lowers pesticide use, saves costs, and improves yields. Ensure marigolds are spaced properly (30–50 cm apart) to avoid competing for nutrients. Use French marigolds (Tagetes patula) for best results."

Question: What causes dandruff in onions?  ","Dandruff-like symptoms in onions are usually caused by fungal diseases like onion smut, downy mildew, or white rot. These thrive in cool, wet soils or humid conditions, especially when onions are overcrowded or planted in poorly drained fields. Smut creates black, powdery spots on leaves, downy mildew causes yellow patches with fuzzy growth, and white rot leads to white mold on bulbs. The fungi spread through contaminated soil, infected seeds, or water.
