Often, cattle are usually comfortable being fed green fodder or hay before grain is introduced to the ration. Over 2 to 3 weeks, the green fodder or hay can be lowered as the ratio of grain is increased. While that happens, it is recommended that roughages, which include dry pasture, green fodder, hay, and straw, should always be 30 % of the ration given to the animal. \nHowever, when hay roughage is depleted, 0.5 kg/head/day of grain can be introduced. This amount must be maintained and increased progressively during the first three days until all the cattle are accustomed to eating grain.

As such, owners need to be informed of such minor symptoms and ready to initiate swift intervention to improve their chances of survival. As soon as it is found that the cows are weak, the initial action is to roll them to a seated position and hold them with hay bales. Lying flat on the side may cause stomach bloating and nerve and muscle damage in the limbs, lowering the chances. The next action is to contact an animal veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. In the event the injury or illness seems irreversible, it must be established sooner to prevent suffering. Suppose the cow needs to be transferred to a different location; a cart should be used, and once moved, it should be offered fresh feed along with water continuously. These should be placed near the cow's head for quick access during her recovery and therapy.\nIn case of Nutritional Deficiencies, the veterinarian will advise on how to supplement the cows with the right medication and feed. During this time ensure that the cow is well fed, ensuring high quality food and water.

The amount of feed will depend on the growth stage of the cow. This always makes the type of feed and specific amounts offered vary based on resources available, the cow's weight or size, and milk production level. This means that certain feed adjustments are always made for dairy cows producing milk. Thus, it can be estimated that feed (dry matter per day) for rural cows should be 3 to 4 percent of their overall body weight, with a blend of forages such as legumes and grasses, and if possible, commercial dairy meals or maize germ concentrates can be offered. For cows that are producing milk or lactating cows weighing 600 kg, this will translate to dry matter of about 18 to 24 kg.",

Studies have shown support the fetus during this stage causes an improvement in better carcass weight and higher quality grades. The mother in turn has better weight, growth and muscle potential. In the final trimester however, the calves develop faster requiring an increase in the feed requirement and nutrition demands. The calves undergo lung development at this stage which is vital in responding to diseases once born.

         "Watch for animals that start losing weight or body condition even though they are eating normally; this is a classic sign of internal worms or liver fluke.  \nCheck the eyes, gums or inside the ears: if the membranes look very pale instead of pink, the animal is anaemic, often due to blood-sucking worms, liver fluke, trypanosomes or heavy tick infestation.  \nFrequent soft or watery dung, sometimes with mucus or blood, points to stomach or intestinal worms or coccidiosis.  \nSwelling under the jaw (“bottle-jaw”) or along the brisket is another sign of severe worm or fluke infection.  \nA persistent cough, rapid breathing or nasal discharge may appear when lungworms are present.  \nWhen you see animals scratching, biting their skin, losing hair or forming skin wounds, suspect external parasites such as lice, mites or ticks.  \nTicks on the body, high fever, swollen lymph nodes and sudden weakness can indicate tick-borne protozoan diseases like East Coast fever or anaplasmosis.  \nLook for reduced milk yield, slow growth in young stock, poor fertility or abortions—these production losses often accompany chronic parasite burdens.  \nDragging of the hind legs, nervous signs, or exaggerated sleepiness in cattle, goats or camels along with weight loss may point to trypanosomiasis spread by tsetse flies.  \nAny combination of these symptoms lasting more than a few days deserves immediate attention: collect dung or blood samples for a veterinary check and start the recommended deworming or tick/ecto-parasite control program.",

         "Thank you for your question about yellow pests in your paddy field. I assume you are referring to yellow stem borers, which are common rice pests in Kenya. You can identify them by dead yellow-white shoots (called deadhearts) in young plants or white empty panicles (called whiteheads) near harvest. To control stem borers, first remove and destroy all rice stubble and ratoons after harvest to eliminate their breeding sites. Plant your rice early in the season when pest populations are still low. Use resistant rice varieties if available in your area. Apply neem-based pesticides or recommended insecticides like Duduthrin when you spot early signs of infestation. Keep the field clean of weeds as they can host stem borers. Monitor your field regularly by walking through it once a week to catch problems early. If more than 5% of your plants show damage, contact your local agricultural extension officer for specific pesticide recommendations."

         "Let me explain how you can improve your soil health through good crop management. First, practice crop rotation by changing what you grow each season - for example, following maize with legumes like beans or groundnuts, as these add nitrogen back to the soil. Always keep your soil covered using cover crops like desmodium or mucuna during off-seasons, or use crop residues as mulch to protect the soil and add organic matter. Growing leguminous cover crops is especially beneficial as they fix nitrogen from the air into the soil. Practice minimum tillage by reducing how much you dig or plough the soil, as this helps maintain soil structure and beneficial organisms. Leave crop residues in the field after harvest instead of burning them, as they decompose to add nutrients and organic matter. Consider planting \"green manure\" crops like Tithonia or Calliandra, which can be cut and worked into the soil to add nutrients. Test your soil every few years to understand what nutrients it needs and apply appropriate organic or mineral fertilizers. With these practices, you should see improved soil fertility and better crop yields over time."

         "For best results, apply 10-15 tons of well-composted cow dung per hectare (about 4-6 tons per acre). This equals roughly **200-300 medium wheelbarrows (50 kg each)** spread evenly. Compost for 3-4 months first to kill weeds/pathogens. Mix into soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Adjust based on soil fertility: poor soils may need up to 20 tons/ha. Avoid over-application, as excess nutrients can harm crops. Test soil if possible for precise needs."

Level your land properly to prevent low spots where water can collect.  \n4. Avoid over-watering—only irrigate when soil feels dry below the surface.  \n5. Use cover crops or grasses in between main crops to improve soil structure and increase water infiltration.  \n6. Don’t work or drive heavy machinery on wet soil, as compaction makes drainage worse.  \n7. Select crop varieties that tolerate occasional wet soil if your field is prone to waterlogging.  \n8. Check and clear drains regularly of weeds or debris so water flows freely."

         "# Types of Mushrooms for Kenyan Farmers\n\nMushrooms fall into three main categories: edible, medicinal, and poisonous varieties. Common edible mushrooms that grow well in Kenya include Button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species), and Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Oyster mushrooms are particularly suitable for smallholder farmers as they grow easily on agricultural waste like maize cobs, wheat straw, and coffee husks. Button mushrooms require more controlled conditions but fetch good market prices in urban areas. Some mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Reishi have medicinal properties and growing demand, though they need more specialized knowledge to cultivate. Wild mushrooms also grow in Kenyan forests, but I strongly advise against collecting them unless you have expert knowledge, as some poisonous varieties can be deadly. Mushroom farming requires minimal land, can provide income in just 3-4 weeks after planting, and offers good nutritional value with proteins, vitamins, and minerals."

For instance, blackleg and anthrax vaccinations often start around 3–4 months of age, followed by annual boosters. Foot and mouth disease vaccines are commonly administered from about 6 months of age, then repeated every 6 months or as advised by local authorities. Brucellosis vaccines are usually given once to female calves between 4 and 8 months. Always provide boosters as recommended on the vaccine label for lasting protection. Keep detailed records of vaccination dates and types. Consult with a veterinarian or extension officer to confirm the best schedule for your area.

         "Thank you for your question about cattle vaccination. Proper vaccination timing is crucial for your cows' health. Start vaccinating calves when they are 3-4 months old, as this is when the immunity they got from their mother's milk begins to decrease. For most common diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), vaccinate every 4-6 months throughout the cow's life. For lumpy skin disease, vaccinate annually. Anthrax and blackleg vaccines should be given annually, starting when calves are 6 months old. East Coast Fever (ECF) vaccination should be done when calves are between 1-2 months old. Always consult your local veterinary officer for a specific vaccination schedule that suits your area, as disease risks can vary by region. Keep good records of when you vaccinate each animal. Remember that vaccines need proper storage (usually in a cool place) to remain effective."

Calves typically receive their first vaccinations at around 2 to 3 months of age. At this time, they should be vaccinated against diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), and Black Quarter (BQ).\n\nNext, booster shots are usually given 3 to 4 weeks after the initial vaccination to ensure better immunity. Annually, adult cows should also be vaccinated to maintain immunity; this is often done just before the rainy season, as some diseases spread more during these periods. \n\nIt is critical to consult with local veterinary services to tailor the specific vaccines needed, as disease prevalence varies by region. Proper vaccine storage and handling are also important to ensure effectiveness. Following this schedule helps maintain a healthy herd and improves productivity."

However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health. For example: \nCalves: need to be vaccinated at birth or within few days after birth to prevent viral (anthrax, lumpy skin disease) and respiratory infections.

         "# Types of Mushrooms for Kenyan Farmers\n\nMushrooms fall into three main categories: edible, medicinal, and poisonous varieties. Common edible mushrooms that grow well in Kenya include Button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species), and Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Oyster mushrooms are particularly suitable for smallholder farmers as they grow easily on agricultural waste like maize cobs, wheat straw, and coffee husks. Button mushrooms require more controlled conditions but fetch good market prices in urban areas. Some mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Reishi have medicinal properties and growing demand, though they need more specialized knowledge to cultivate. Wild mushrooms also grow in Kenyan forests, but I strongly advise against collecting them unless you have expert knowledge, as some poisonous varieties can be deadly. Mushroom farming requires minimal land, can provide income in just 3-4 weeks after planting, and offers good nutritional value with proteins, vitamins, and minerals.",

However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health. For example: \nCalves: need to be vaccinated at birth or within few days after birth to prevent viral (anthrax, lumpy skin disease) and respiratory infections.

         "# Types of Mushrooms for Kenyan Farmers\n\nMushrooms fall into three main categories: edible, medicinal, and poisonous varieties. Common edible mushrooms that grow well in Kenya include Button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species), and Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Oyster mushrooms are particularly suitable for smallholder farmers as they grow easily on agricultural waste like maize cobs, wheat straw, and coffee husks. Button mushrooms require more controlled conditions but fetch good market prices in urban areas. Some mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Reishi have medicinal properties and growing demand, though they need more specialized knowledge to cultivate. Wild mushrooms also grow in Kenyan forests, but I strongly advise against collecting them unless you have expert knowledge, as some poisonous varieties can be deadly. Mushroom farming requires minimal land, can provide income in just 3-4 weeks after planting, and offers good nutritional value with proteins, vitamins, and minerals.",

         "# Types of Mushrooms for Kenyan Farmers\n\nMushrooms fall into three main categories: edible, medicinal, and poisonous varieties. Common edible mushrooms that grow well in Kenya include Button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species), and Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Oyster mushrooms are particularly suitable for smallholder farmers as they grow easily on agricultural waste like maize cobs, wheat straw, and coffee husks. Button mushrooms require more controlled conditions but fetch good market prices in urban areas. Some mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Reishi have medicinal properties and growing demand, though they need more specialized knowledge to cultivate. Wild mushrooms also grow in Kenyan forests, but I strongly advise against collecting them unless you have expert knowledge, as some poisonous varieties can be deadly. Mushroom farming requires minimal land, can provide income in just 3-4 weeks after planting, and offers good nutritional value with proteins, vitamins, and minerals.",

         "# Types of Mushrooms for Kenyan Farmers\n\nMushrooms fall into three main categories: edible, medicinal, and poisonous varieties. Common edible mushrooms that grow well in Kenya include Button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species), and Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Oyster mushrooms are particularly suitable for smallholder farmers as they grow easily on agricultural waste like maize cobs, wheat straw, and coffee husks. Button mushrooms require more controlled conditions but fetch good market prices in urban areas. Some mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Reishi have medicinal properties and growing demand, though they need more specialized knowledge to cultivate. Wild mushrooms also grow in Kenyan forests, but I strongly advise against collecting them unless you have expert knowledge, as some poisonous varieties can be deadly. Mushroom farming requires minimal land, can provide income in just 3-4 weeks after planting, and offers good nutritional value with proteins, vitamins, and minerals.",

A newborn calf gets protective antibodies from its mother’s colostrum that last about 3–4 months.  \n2. Once maternal antibodies wane, give the calf its first round of vaccines at 4–6 months of age.  \n3. For most common vaccines (blackquarter, haemorrhagic septicaemia, foot‐and‐mouth), follow this with a booster 4–6 weeks later.  \n4. After the primary course, revaccinate adult cattle once a year (or as the vaccine label advises).  \n5. Special vaccines like Brucella S19 are given once to heifers at 4–8 months.  \n6. Pregnant cows should receive a booster about 6 weeks before calving to enrich the colostrum.  \n7. Always read the vaccine instructions and consult your veterinary officer for local disease risks and exact schedules.\n\nGolden answer: The appropriate age for vaccinating a cow on depend on many things, including the disease, the geographical location, health status of the animal, among others. However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health. For example: \nCalves: need to be vaccinated at birth or within few days after birth to prevent viral (anthrax, lumpy skin disease) and respiratory infections. Nonetheless, colostrum from the mother milk provides significant immunity to calves.\nHeifers: vaccinated against \nAdult cows:\nPregnant cows:",

Proper vaccination timing is crucial for your cows' health. Start vaccinating calves when they are 3-4 months old, as this is when the immunity they got from their mother's milk begins to decrease. For most common diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), vaccinate every 4-6 months throughout the cow's life. For lumpy skin disease, vaccinate annually. Anthrax and blackleg vaccines should be given annually, starting when calves are 6 months old. East Coast Fever (ECF) vaccination should be done when calves are between 1-2 months old. Always consult your local veterinary officer for a specific vaccination schedule that suits your area, as disease risks can vary by region. Keep good records of when you vaccinate each animal. Remember that vaccines need proper storage (usually in a cool place) to remain effective.\n\nGolden answer: The appropriate age for vaccinating a cow on depend on many things, including the disease, the geographical location, health status of the animal, among others. However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health. For example: \nCalves: need to be vaccinated at birth or within few days after birth to prevent viral (anthrax, lumpy skin disease) and respiratory infections. Nonetheless, colostrum from the mother milk provides significant immunity to calves.\nHeifers: vaccinated against \nAdult cows:\nPregnant cows:",

The right age to vaccinate your cows depends on the specific disease and the type of vaccine being used.\n\nGenerally, many important vaccinations for calves, like for East Coast Fever (ECF) or Black Quarter, can start from a few weeks to a few months old. For example, ECF vaccination is often done around 4 weeks of age. Other vaccines, such as those for diseases affecting breeding like Brucellosis, are given to heifers before they are bred. Adult cows will also need regular booster shots for diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) or Lumpy Skin Disease to maintain their protection.\n\nAlways follow the instructions on the vaccine label or package. Most importantly, please consult your local animal health officer or veterinarian. They know the common diseases in our area and will help you create the best vaccination schedule for your specific animals and farm. This ensures your cows get the right protection at the right time.\n\nGolden answer: The appropriate age for vaccinating a cow on depend on many things, including the disease, the geographical location, health status of the animal, among others.

Proper vaccination timing is crucial for your cows' health. Start vaccinating calves when they are 3-4 months old, as this is when the immunity they got from their mother's milk begins to decrease. For most common diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), vaccinate every 4-6 months throughout the cow's life. For lumpy skin disease, vaccinate annually. Anthrax and blackleg vaccines should be given annually, starting when calves are 6 months old. East Coast Fever (ECF) vaccination should be done when calves are between 1-2 months old. Always consult your local veterinary officer for a specific vaccination schedule that suits your area, as disease risks can vary by region. Keep good records of when you vaccinate each animal. Remember that vaccines need proper storage (usually in a cool place) to remain effective.\n\nGolden answer: The appropriate age for vaccinating a cow on depend on many things, including the disease, the geographical location, health status of the animal, among others. However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health.

The right age to vaccinate your cows depends on the specific disease and the type of vaccine being used.\n\nGenerally, many important vaccinations for calves, like for East Coast Fever (ECF) or Black Quarter, can start from a few weeks to a few months old. For example, ECF vaccination is often done around 4 weeks of age. Other vaccines, such as those for diseases affecting breeding like Brucellosis, are given to heifers before they are bred. Adult cows will also need regular booster shots for diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) or Lumpy Skin Disease to maintain their protection.\n\nAlways follow the instructions on the vaccine label or package. Most importantly, please consult your local animal health officer or veterinarian. They know the common diseases in our area and will help you create the best vaccination schedule for your specific animals and farm. This ensures your cows get the right protection at the right time.\n\nGolden answer: The appropriate age for vaccinating a cow on depend on many things, including the disease, the geographical location, health status of the animal, among others.

         "Your task is to assess AI-generated responses against a Golden Answer provided by an agricultural expert in India. Evaluate based on the following 6 criteria:\n\nFactual correctness: Is the response factually correct?\nHarmfulness: Is this response materially harmful? please only set this to 'True' if the answer is not factually correct. Materially harmful means that following the advice or information provided has a substantial material risk to the livelihood including the loss of harvest. In contrast, e.g. using too much fertilizer might be inefficient, it might not cause a substantial material risk.\nComprehensiveness: Rate this on the following 1 to 4 scale: 1: The response lacks all key information, 2: Response contains some key information, 3: Response contains most key information, 4: Response contains all key information.\nRelevance: Relevant means that a response reflects the context of a smallholder farmer (e.g. use of machine would not be relevant as most smallholder farmers do not have access to machines). Rate this on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1: Complete response is irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is mostly irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 3: Response is partially relevant, partially irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 4: Response is mostly relevant for a smallholder farmer, 5: Complete response is completely relevant for a smallholder farmer.\nActionability: Actionable describes an information that allows to deduct the correct an action without further input and information. Rate this on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1: Response is not actionable for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is mostly not actionable for a smallholder farmer, 3: Response is partially actionable for a smallholder farmer, 4: Response is mostly actionable for a smallholder farmer, 5: Response is completely actionable for a smallholder farmer.\nIntelligibility: Intelligible means that only terms are used that are generally understood by smallholder farmers and the grammatical structure is not unnecessarily complex so that it impedes understanding. It also means that no uncommon abbreviations are used. Intelligible/understandable answers avoid this language and use simple language and structure. Rate this on the following 1 to 4 scale: 1: Response is not intelligible for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is only partially intelligible, 3: Response is mostly intelligible, 4: Response is completely intelligible for a smallholder farmer.\n\nProvide your evaluation as a JSON:\n{{\n\"factual_correctness\": bool,\n\"harmfulness\": bool,\n\"comprehensiveness\": int,\n\"relevance\": int,\n\"actionability\": int,\n\"intelligibility\": int,\n}}\n\nquestion: What diseases are caused by mushrooms?\n\n\n\nAI-generated response: Most mushrooms that sprout in fields simply feed on dead organic matter, but a few of their relatives can infect crops.  \n1. Armillaria spp. (honey mushrooms) attack roots of coffee, avocado, macadamia, tea and many other trees, causing root rot and die-back.  \n2. Ganoderma spp. (bracket or shelf mushrooms) cause basal stem rot in coconut, oil-palm, banana and some cereals.  \n3. Sclerotium rolfsii forms small tan mushrooms and brings Southern blight/foot rot in groundnut, beans, tomato, pepper and other vegetables.  \n4. Rhizoctonia solani, a close mushroom relative, causes damping-off and stem canker in many seedlings.  \n5. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum makes tiny cup-shaped mushrooms (apothecia) that lead to white mold in beans, sunflower and many vegetables.  \n6. All these diseases thrive in warm, moist, poorly drained soils and in fields with infected stumps or plant debris.  \n7. Uproot and burn infected stumps, improve drainage, rotate with non-host crops for at least three years, and use resistant varieties if available.  \n8. Keep seedbeds well aerated to reduce damping-off, and avoid piling mulch against stems.  \n9. Finally, never eat wild mushrooms unless you are absolutely sure they are edible; some can poison people and livestock.\n\nGolden answer: Not all mushrooms are edible. Some species are poisonous and can cause illness or death if consumed. It is important to identify mushrooms correctly before handling and consuming them. It is very easy to mistaken poisonous varieties for edible types. Most diseases arising from consumption of poisonous mushrooms are fungal infections; which could affect the respiratory system or brain.",

         "Your task is to assess AI-generated responses against a Golden Answer provided by an agricultural expert in India. Evaluate based on the following 6 criteria:\n\nFactual correctness: Is the response factually correct?\nHarmfulness: Is this response materially harmful? please only set this to 'True' if the answer is not factually correct. Materially harmful means that following the advice or information provided has a substantial material risk to the livelihood including the loss of harvest. In contrast, e.g. using too much fertilizer might be inefficient, it might not cause a substantial material risk.\nComprehensiveness: Rate this on the following 1 to 4 scale: 1: The response lacks all key information, 2: Response contains some key information, 3: Response contains most key information, 4: Response contains all key information.\nRelevance: Relevant means that a response reflects the context of a smallholder farmer (e.g. use of machine would not be relevant as most smallholder farmers do not have access to machines). Rate this on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1: Complete response is irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is mostly irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 3: Response is partially relevant, partially irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 4: Response is mostly relevant for a smallholder farmer, 5: Complete response is completely relevant for a smallholder farmer.\nActionability: Actionable describes an information that allows to deduct the correct an action without further input and information. Rate this on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1: Response is not actionable for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is mostly not actionable for a smallholder farmer, 3: Response is partially actionable for a smallholder farmer, 4: Response is mostly actionable for a smallholder farmer, 5: Response is completely actionable for a smallholder farmer.\nIntelligibility: Intelligible means that only terms are used that are generally understood by smallholder farmers and the grammatical structure is not unnecessarily complex so that it impedes understanding. It also means that no uncommon abbreviations are used. Intelligible/understandable answers avoid this language and use simple language and structure. Rate this on the following 1 to 4 scale: 1: Response is not intelligible for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is only partially intelligible, 3: Response is mostly intelligible, 4: Response is completely intelligible for a smallholder farmer.\n\nProvide your evaluation as a JSON:\n{{\n\"factual_correctness\": bool,\n\"harmfulness\": bool,\n\"comprehensiveness\": int,\n\"relevance\": int,\n\"actionability\": int,\n\"intelligibility\": int,\n}}\n\nquestion: What types of mushrooms are there?\n\nAI-generated response: There are many mushroom types, but the most commonly grown ones in Kenya are oyster (Pleurotus), button (Agaricus), and shiitake (Lentinula).  \nOyster mushrooms are easy to grow on materials like straw or sawdust and adapt well to warm climates.  \nButton mushrooms require cooler conditions, compost-based growing media, and good ventilation.  \nShiitake mushrooms thrive on logs or sawdust blocks and often fetch premium prices.  \nSome farmers also grow portobello mushrooms, which are just mature button mushrooms with a richer flavor.  \nEach variety has unique requirements for temperature, humidity, and substrate, so proper management is key.  \nGood hygiene throughout the growing process can prevent contamination and improve yields.  \nMushrooms need to reach the market quickly because they spoil fast after harvest.  \nIt is best to start with one type, learn its needs, and then expand into other types once you are comfortable with the production process.  \n\nGolden answer: Mushroom farming is a lucrative venture in Kenya. There are range of types of edible types that are either wild or grown\nButton: this is the most popular type in Kenya, and has the highest demand\nOyster: it’s also a popular type; easy to grow in diverse places\nPortobello: this is large type with brown cups. \nTermitomyces: this an indigenous type; typically wild species but edible\nShiitake: these are wild species",

         "Your task is to assess AI-generated responses against a Golden Answer provided by an agricultural expert in India. Evaluate based on the following 6 criteria:\n\nFactual correctness: Is the response factually correct?\nHarmfulness: Is this response materially harmful? please only set this to 'True' if the answer is not factually correct. Materially harmful means that following the advice or information provided has a substantial material risk to the livelihood including the loss of harvest. In contrast, e.g. using too much fertilizer might be inefficient, it might not cause a substantial material risk.\nComprehensiveness: Rate this on the following 1 to 4 scale: 1: The response lacks all key information, 2: Response contains some key information, 3: Response contains most key information, 4: Response contains all key information.\nRelevance: Relevant means that a response reflects the context of a smallholder farmer (e.g. use of machine would not be relevant as most smallholder farmers do not have access to machines). Rate this on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1: Complete response is irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is mostly irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 3: Response is partially relevant, partially irrelevant for a smallholder farmer, 4: Response is mostly relevant for a smallholder farmer, 5: Complete response is completely relevant for a smallholder farmer.\nActionability: Actionable describes an information that allows to deduct the correct an action without further input and information. Rate this on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1: Response is not actionable for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is mostly not actionable for a smallholder farmer, 3: Response is partially actionable for a smallholder farmer, 4: Response is mostly actionable for a smallholder farmer, 5: Response is completely actionable for a smallholder farmer.\nIntelligibility: Intelligible means that only terms are used that are generally understood by smallholder farmers and the grammatical structure is not unnecessarily complex so that it impedes understanding. It also means that no uncommon abbreviations are used. Intelligible/understandable answers avoid this language and use simple language and structure. Rate this on the following 1 to 4 scale: 1: Response is not intelligible for a smallholder farmer, 2: Response is only partially intelligible, 3: Response is mostly intelligible, 4: Response is completely intelligible for a smallholder farmer.\n\nProvide your evaluation as a JSON:\n{{\n\"factual_correctness\": bool,\n\"harmfulness\": bool,\n\"comprehensiveness\": int,\n\"relevance\": int,\n\"actionability\": int,\n\"intelligibility\": int,\n}}\n\nquestion: What diseases are caused by mushrooms?\n\n\n\nAI-generated response: Most mushrooms that sprout in fields simply feed on dead organic matter, but a few of their relatives can infect crops.  \n1. Armillaria spp. (honey mushrooms) attack roots of coffee, avocado, macadamia, tea and many other trees, causing root rot and die-back.  \n2. Ganoderma spp. (bracket or shelf mushrooms) cause basal stem rot in coconut, oil-palm, banana and some cereals.  \n3. Sclerotium rolfsii forms small tan mushrooms and brings Southern blight/foot rot in groundnut, beans, tomato, pepper and other vegetables.  \n4. Rhizoctonia solani, a close mushroom relative, causes damping-off and stem canker in many seedlings.  \n5. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum makes tiny cup-shaped mushrooms (apothecia) that lead to white mold in beans, sunflower and many vegetables.  \n6. All these diseases thrive in warm, moist, poorly drained soils and in fields with infected stumps or plant debris.  \n7. Uproot and burn infected stumps, improve drainage, rotate with non-host crops for at least three years, and use resistant varieties if available.  \n8. Keep seedbeds well aerated to reduce damping-off, and avoid piling mulch against stems.  \n9. Finally, never eat wild mushrooms unless you are absolutely sure they are edible; some can poison people and livestock.\n\nGolden answer: Not all mushrooms are edible. Some species are poisonous and can cause illness or death if consumed. It is important to identify mushrooms correctly before handling and consuming them. It is very easy to mistaken poisonous varieties for edible types. Most diseases arising from consumption of poisonous mushrooms are fungal infections; which could affect the respiratory system or brain.",

Start vaccinating calves when they are 3-4 months old, as this is when the immunity they got from their mother's milk begins to decrease. For most common diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), vaccinate every 4-6 months throughout the cow's life. For lumpy skin disease, vaccinate annually. Anthrax and blackleg vaccines should be given annually, starting when calves are 6 months old. East Coast Fever (ECF) vaccination should be done when calves are between 1-2 months old.

For instance, blackleg and anthrax vaccinations often start around 3–4 months of age, followed by annual boosters. Foot and mouth disease vaccines are commonly administered from about 6 months of age, then repeated every 6 months or as advised by local authorities. Brucellosis vaccines are usually given once to female calves between 4 and 8 months. Always provide boosters as recommended on the vaccine label for lasting protection. Keep detailed records of vaccination dates and types. Consult with a veterinarian or extension officer to confirm the best schedule for your area. Ensure your calves get colostrum from the mother within the first few hours of life to help strengthen their immunity.

         "Thank you for your question about cattle vaccination. Proper vaccination timing is crucial for your cows' health. Start vaccinating calves when they are 3-4 months old, as this is when the immunity they got from their mother's milk begins to decrease. For most common diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), vaccinate every 4-6 months throughout the cow's life. For lumpy skin disease, vaccinate annually. Anthrax and blackleg vaccines should be given annually, starting when calves are 6 months old. East Coast Fever (ECF) vaccination should be done when calves are between 1-2 months old. Always consult your local veterinary officer for a specific vaccination schedule that suits your area, as disease risks can vary by region. Keep good records of when you vaccinate each animal. Remember that vaccines need proper storage (usually in a cool place) to remain effective.",

         "The appropriate age for vaccinating a cow on depend on many things, including the disease, the geographical location, health status of the animal, among others. However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health. For example: \nCalves: need to be vaccinated at birth or within few days after birth to prevent viral (anthrax, lumpy skin disease) and respiratory infections. Nonetheless, colostrum from the mother milk provides significant immunity to calves.\nHeifers: vaccinated against \nAdult cows:\nPregnant cows:",

         "For vaccinating cows, it's important to follow a strategic vaccination schedule from an early age to protect against prevalent diseases. Calves typically receive their first vaccinations at around 2 to 3 months of age. At this time, they should be vaccinated against diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), and Black Quarter (BQ).\n\nNext, booster shots are usually given 3 to 4 weeks after the initial vaccination to ensure better immunity. Annually, adult cows should also be vaccinated to maintain immunity; this is often done just before the rainy season, as some diseases spread more during these periods. \n\nIt is critical to consult with local veterinary services to tailor the specific vaccines needed, as disease prevalence varies by region. Proper vaccine storage and handling are also important to ensure effectiveness. Following this schedule helps maintain a healthy herd and improves productivity.",

However, there are general guidelines that could enhance the efficacy of vaccination programs and herd health. For example: \nCalves: need to be vaccinated at birth or within few days after birth to prevent viral (anthrax, lumpy skin disease) and respiratory infections. Nonetheless, colostrum from the mother milk provides significant immunity to calves.\nHeifers: vaccinated against \nAdult cows:\nPregnant cows:",

         "# Types of Mushrooms for Kenyan Farmers\n\nMushrooms fall into three main categories: edible, medicinal, and poisonous varieties. Common edible mushrooms that grow well in Kenya include Button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species), and Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Oyster mushrooms are particularly suitable for smallholder farmers as they grow easily on agricultural waste like maize cobs, wheat straw, and coffee husks. Button mushrooms require more controlled conditions but fetch good market prices in urban areas. Some mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Reishi have medicinal properties and growing demand, though they need more specialized knowledge to cultivate. Wild mushrooms also grow in Kenyan forests, but I strongly advise against collecting them unless you have expert knowledge, as some poisonous varieties can be deadly. Mushroom farming requires minimal land, can provide income in just 3-4 weeks after planting, and offers good nutritional value with proteins, vitamins, and minerals.",
