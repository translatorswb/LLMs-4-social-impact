1	kenya	I have been applying different pesticides to control pests on my farm. However, they seem not to be effective, what can I do?	Rely on integrated pest management (IPM) by combining cultural, physical, biological and chemical control. Cultural involves timely planting, use of ash and crushed chilling and other traditional methods. Physical method involves handpicking and crushing of the pest. Biological control involves the use of beneficial insects like ladybugs and other living organisms to manage the pest. Take note, when undertaking chemical control, apply pesticides that have different active ingredients during repeat sprays to manage pest resistance
2	kenya	I have been losing my crops and livestock due to drought and floods. What can I do to get compensation during such occurrences?	Explore crop insurance policies which protect crops against loss due to natural disasters like drought and floods. The cover should be index-based insurance which uses weather data to trigger payouts. These includes the a) Area Yield Index Insurance (AYII), which is a crop insurance product based on average losses at the regional level, rather than farm level. And their pay- outs are based on crop cutting experiments. b) Weather Index Insurance (WII) which is a crop insurance based on weather parameters such as rainfall, temperature, or soil moisture correlated with farm-level yields or revenue outcomes. c) Index based Livestock insurance covers livestock products with high initial infrastructure development cost and low transactional costs.
3	kenya	I am interested in learning about crops and livestock production. Where can I visit to learn more about crops and livestock production?	Visit agricultural research institutions such as the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) for expert knowledge on crops and livestock production. Agricultural training centers and demonstration farms, such as those run by county governments and universities offer hands-on learning to farmers. Also, Farmers' field schools (FFS) and cooperatives provide peer-to-peer learning and practical experience. Additionally, agricultural expos, trade fairs, and digital platforms provide updated information, learning and networking opportunities.
4	kenya	Which bean variety is suitable for dryland agro-ecological zone?	In Kenya's dry agroecological zones, the most suitable bean varieties are drought-tolerant and early-maturing. Some recommended varieties include: Rosecoco (GLP 2), Chelalang, Mwezi Moja, Nyota and KAT Bean Series (KAT B1, KAT B9, KAT X56). These varieties are ideal for dryland farming due to their ability to withstand water stress and still produce reasonable yields.
5	kenya	If I am unable to acquire certified maize seeds, which variety can I save and replant the next season?	Open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) can be saved and replanted again, as they retain their genetic traits across generations. Some suitable OPVs in Kenya include:KATUMANI Composite B (KCB) for dry regions, DH01 & DH02 for various ecological zones, Coast Composite for coastal lowland areas and Kinyanya (KARI Mtama 1) for drier areas. Avoid saving and replanting hybrid maize seeds (e.g., H614, H6210) as they lose their yield potential in subsequent seasons due to genetic isolation.
6	kenya	Are chemical pesticides important and safe in crop and livestock production?	Chemical pesticides are important in crop and livestock production as they help control pests, diseases, and weeds, leading to increased yields and food security. However, their safety depends on proper use, including adhering to recommended application rates, pre-harvest intervals, and protective measures. However, misuse can lead to environmental pollution, pesticide resistance, and health risks for humans and animals.
7	kenya	How can I know that my soil is fertile?	Conduct a soil test which will provide information on nutrient levels, pH and organic matter content. Observing plant growth and crop performance is another indicator where healthy plants equal fertile soils. The presence of soil organisms like earthworms reflect soil fertile. A well-drained soil yet retains moisture can indicate fertility. Lastly, observing certain symptoms on plants such as yellowing of leaves and stunted growth can indicate an imbalance of nutrients in the soil.
8	kenya	How can I best control weeds in my farm?	Weeds compete with crops for water, nutrients and space, and they habor pests and diseases. Common weed control methods are mechanical and use of chemicals/herbicides. Mechanical control entails hand pulling, use of a hoe/jembe/panga or slashing. Herbicides are applied either before or after crops emerge. Herbicides are also classified as broad spectrum or selective. The broad spectrums indiscriminately kill all plants while the selective types could target either broad-leaved plants or narrow-leaf plants, mostly grasses. It is important to control weeds early to maximize crop yield.
9	kenya	How do organic and synthetic/inorganic fertilizers compare in terms of effectiveness to crop production, and which one would be more suitable for different farming conditions?	Organic fertilizers are those that are obtained from farm yard manure and compost, and their nutrient concentration depend on the material they have been made from and storage conditions. Inorganic fertilizers are those that we buy from the shops, such as CAN, DAP, UREA and NPK, among others. On weight basis, organic fertilizers have lower nutrient concentration compared with inorganic fertilizers. Also, inorganic fertilizer release nutrients to crop very fast while the organic materials undergo a longer process. Thus, inorganic fertilizers are a better choice when you want to quickly improve the nutrition status of your crops. However, organic fertilizers improve the overall soil health through the addition organic matter to the soil which improves nutrient availability and water holding capacity, as well aeration of the soil. Organic farming predominantly depends on organic fertilizers. 
10	kenya	Lately, the onset of rains has shown significant variability from season to season. This has affected our ability to judge when to plant. In this scenario, when is the best time to plant?	Early planting or dry planting is the best practice in the wake of climate change. Here, you plant at least a week before the predicted start of the rainy season. In addition, decisions as to when to plan could be informed by keenly following up with updates from the Kenya Meteorological Department, which are frequently communicated by the local radio and television stations. In addition, the Kenya Observatory Platform provides crucial weather advisory data.
11	kenya	What are the signs of nutrient deficiency in maize and how can they be corrected?	Signs of nutrient deficiency depend on the nutrient and vary from crop to crop. The key nutrients to observe for their deficiency are Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. For example, in maize, nitrogen deficient crops show stunted and sparse growth, leaves turn pale green and the older leaves yellow discoloration with necrosis/drying starting from the leaf tip. Phosphorous deficiency in young plants presents as dwarfed and thin plants with dark green leaves. Later, the older leaves of the young plants turn purple. Nutrient deficiencies are corrected through the use of fertilizers, and the fertilizer has to be applied from the right source, right rate/amount, right time and placed rightly near the plant root zone for quick uptake.
12	kenya	How can I mitigate post-harvest losses in crops and livestock?	Postharvest losses contribute to nearly 30% of total yield loss in crops but the severity of the loss depends on the perishability of the commodity. These losses are caused by poor storage conditions as well as pest damage. For non-perishable grain crops, harvesting at the right maturity stage is recommended, as well storing the grain in containers that restrict pest attack. In addition, pesticides (grain dusts) control pest attack. For perishable commodities such as vegetables and fruits, and milk, cold storage conditions are important to prolong the produce shelve life.
13	kenya	What are some of the strategies that I can employ to manage climate change in crop production?	Climate change encompasses low and unpredictable rainfall and high temperatures (heat stress). Strategies to manage these challenges could include early planting, drought tolerant varieties as well as water harvesting and supplemental irrigation. On-farm water harvesting strategies are open furrow-and ridges, tied ridges, zai pits, use of mulch to conserve moisture, among others.
14	kenya	What are the best disease management practices in livestock production?	Disease management in livestock includes surveillance, prevention and treatment. Surveillance entails regular monitoring of disease occurrence and quick response to the disease. Prevention pertains proper nutrition, vaccination, avoidance of infected areas, cleanliness and mixing of breeds to diverse risks. Treatment refers to measures taken to inject drugs to the animal, and this must be administered by a qualified veterinary doctor.
15	kenya	How are Farmer groups, Farmer Producer Organizations, Community Based Organizations and cooperatives important to farmers?	Farmer groups, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), and cooperatives play a vital role in enhancing market access, collective bargaining power, and resource sharing for its members. These organizations help farmers access quality inputs, financial services, and training on best agricultural practices, improving productivity and profitability. They also facilitate bulk selling, reducing exploitation by middlemen, and enable value addition through processing and packaging.
