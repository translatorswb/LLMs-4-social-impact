Which irrigation method is most efficient for water conservation in Kenya's dry regions?,A. Drip Irrigation;B. Flood irrigation;C. Overhead sprinkler irrigation;D. Basin irrigation;E. Furrow irrigation,A,"In dry regions, water is a limited resource and needs to be conserved. Drip irrigation is the most efficient technique to conserve water as its released to the root zones to guarantee uptake by the crop.",1
How do I apply fertilizer in my farm to maximize yield and profitability?,"A. Apply fertilizer randomly across the field without considering soil conditions.;B. Through spot application apply the right type, right amount, and at the right time as guided by the soil testing results.;C. Apply only nitrogen fertilizers, as other nutrients are not necessary for crop growth.;D. Apply excessive amounts of fertilizer to ensure faster plant growth and higher yields.;E. Apply fertilizer when it starts raining.",B,"Fertilizer application is a technique that requires the right approach to reduce losses due to volatilization and leaching. Thus, the application should be at the right time, right rate, with the right type of fertilizer and method.",2
What are the best practices in the intercropping of legume crops with cereal crops?,"A. Plant cereals densely to outcompete legumes;B. Select compatible crops, ensure timely planting, ensure proper spacing to avoid competition, and rotate rows to maximize resource use.;C. Apply nitrogen fertilizer heavily to support both crops;D. Harvest legumes before they mature to reduce shading;E. Repeatedly intercropping the same legumes with the same cereals season after season",B,"Intercropping enhances productivity when compatible crops are selected, as they will not compete but utilize resources adequately. However, take note of planting time, spacing, and weeding to ensure intercropping benefits both crops.",3
Which is the best way to apply herbicide in my maize field? ,"A. Apply herbicide at any stage of maize growth.;B. Spray herbicide when weeds are mature for maximum effectiveness.;C. Apply pre-emergence herbicide after planting and post-emergence herbicide when weeds are young.;
D. Increase herbicide concentration to kill all weeds in one application.;E. Spraying herbicides during windy, rainy, or extremely hot conditions",C,"Weed suppression before and after emergence of the maize is crucial to minimize competition with the main crop for nutrients, sunlight and space. This approach avoids over use of chemical herbicides that would be harmful to the environment.",4
Which is the best practice for storing grain to mitigate against post-harvest losses?,A. Storing dry maize in airtight hermetic bags or well aerated sisal and on a pallet.;B. Storing maize in plastic bags without checking the moisture content.;C. Storing dry maize in well aerated bags and placing them on bare ground.;D. Storing both old grains and new grains in the same bags;E. Storing maize in ordinary bags that allow pest and moisture penetration to the grains.,A,"Post harvest losses in grain occur due to pests, mold, and moisture. Use airtight hermetic bags to prevent pest infestation to maintain high quality of grains stored. Well aerated sisal bags will allow proper air circulation thus preventing mold growth. Placing the bags on pallets prevents moisture absorption from the ground and reduces contamination from rodents.",5
Which livestock breed is best for dairy production?,A. Ayrshire;B. Sahiwal;C. Friesian;D. Red Maasai;E. Jersey,"A, C, E","Best livestock breeds are bred for high milk yield, quality, and efficiency in feed conversion. These includes Friesian, Jersey and Ayrshire.",6
Which livestock breed is best for beef production?,A. Jersey;B. Sahiwal;C. Boran;D. Brahman;E. Guernsey,"B, C, D","Best livestock breeds for beef are bred for meat, faster maturity, and adaptability to harsh environments. These includes Boran, Sahiwal, and Brahman",7
What are the suitable crops for drought prone areas?,A. Maize and cabbage;B. Sorghum and millet;C. Rice and sugarcane;D. Green grams and pigeon peas;E. Wheat and bananas,"B, D","Best crops for drought prone areas are tolerant to water stress. Some crops that are suitable for such areas include Sorghum, millet, green grams and pigeon peas",8
\Which farming practices reduce soil erosion in slopy areas?,A. Monocropping;B. Contour farming;C. Excessive tillage;D. Planting shallow-rooted crops;E. Having bare ground,B,Contour farming is the most effective practice for reducing soil erosion in sloped areas. It involves plowing and planting along the natural contours of the land rather than up and down the slope to reduce water runoff and soil erosion.,9
What are the ways of controlling fall armyworm infestation?,A. Spray fungicide;B. Remove attacked crops;C. Spray FAW pesticides early or late in the day in the maize whorl;D. Spraying with crude plant extracts;E. Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers to boost plant growth,C,Fall armyworm (FAW) is a destructive pest that primarily attacks maize and other cereal crops. The most effective method to control FAW is to apply registered pesticides early in the morning or late in the evening when the larvae are actively feeding in the maize whorl. Applying in the whorl increases the contact of the pest with the insecticides.,10
Which fertilizer application method is more effective for rainfed crops?,A. Broadcasting;B. Fertigation;C. Foliar application;D. Banding around the crop;E. Deep Placement in the soil,D,"The most effective fertilizer application method for rainfed crops is banding around the crop because it ensures nutrients are placed close to the root zone, reducing nutrient loss and improving uptake efficiency",11
Which fertilizer is suitable during top-dressing of maize?,"A. DAP;B. NPK;C. CAN, UREA;D. Organic fertilizer;E. MOP",C,"During top dressing, maize requires fertilizers that are rich in nitrogen, which is essential for vegetative growth. CAN and UREA are the best choices for top-dressing maize. However, they should be applied properly to avoid losses through leaching and volatilization",12
Which disease should I look at during cold weather in poultry?,A. Newcastle disease;B. Coccidiosis;C. Aspergillosis;D. Fowlpox;E. Pneumonia and respiratory distress,"B, E","During cold weather, poultry is more vulnerable to respiratory and stress-related diseases. Pneumonia, coccidiosis, and respiratory distress are the most common health issues in cold conditions because low temperatures and high humidity weaken the birds' immune systems, increasing their susceptibility to infections.",13
Which one is not a benefit of crop rotation?,"A. Soil fertility improvement;B. Break pest, disease and weed cycle;C. Improve soil properties and rainwater penetration;D. Leads to continuous use of the same nutrients;E. Improved biodiversity",D,"Crop rotation does not lead to continuous use of the same nutrients. However, it prevents nutrient depletion through alternating crops with varying nutrient requirements thus creating soil fertility balance",14
Which dairy production system is suitable in high potential and densely populated areas?,A. Open grazing;B.Intensive (stall feeding/zero grazing);C. Semi intensive;D. Free-range grazing;E. Nomadic pastoralism;,B,"In high-potential and densely populated areas, land resource limited making intensive (stall feeding/zero grazing) the most suitable dairy production system because this system allows farmers to maximize milk production by confining cows in a well-managed space where they are provided with high-quality feed, water, and veterinary care. Unlike open grazing, free-range grazing, or nomadic pastoralism, which require large land areas.",15
