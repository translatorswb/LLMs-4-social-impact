What should I do to prevent the mango tree from rotting and falling ,"Mango trees have a long lifespan of about 40-60 years. However, poor drainage as well as overwatering could lead to rotting and falling of the trees. Poor drainage creates waterlogged conditions that lead roots from fungal infections such as fusarium wilt, phytophthora infestans. In areas that prone to water logging, it is recommended to earth-up the soil around the root area. 
Overwatering would create a consistently moist environment for fungal growth. In this case, it recommended to avoid continuous supply of water and adopt intermittent watering regime. ",What do you see on the roots of the fallen mango trees?,
What are alternative crops to cowdung?,"Dung and manure are important sources of plant nutrients and microorganisms. However, when cow dung is not available one can source for compost waste, green manure and kitchen waste. Compost waste is a mixture of organic waste such as leaves, plant residues, food waste, and also animal manure that can be composted to improve the soil physical, biological and chemical properties. Green manure are cover crops that are grown and ploughed back into the soil when they attain a certain vegetative growth aiming at improving the soil fertility and structure. Some crops used for green manure include legumes like peas, clove, grasses like oats. Additionally, kitchen waste are a good source of nutrients when composted  properly. They are made from vegetable and fruit peels and food remains.

"Can the quantity of grain be increased in the absence of green fodder?

","Maintaining the ratio of green fodder to grain is important in livestock production. However, when green fodder is not available, one can supplement it with grains. Often, cattle are usually comfortable being fed green fodder or hay before grain is introduced to the ration. Over 2 to 3 weeks, the green fodder or hay can be lowered as the ratio of grain is increased. While that happens, it is recommended that roughages, which include dry pasture, green fodder, hay, and straw, should always be 30 % of the ration given to the animal. 
However, when hay roughage is depleted, 0.5 kg/head/day of grain can be introduced. This amount must be maintained and increased progressively during the first three days until all the cattle are accustomed to eating grain. Farmers are, however, advised to be watchful, as feeding grain during the first period might potentially lead to health problems such as bloating.",Which green fodder have you grown in your farm?,
"How do I to recognize milk fever in cows?

","Milk fever is a disease caused by deficiency of blood calcium mostly during calving. This condition occurs mostly in late pregnancies and early days of lactation where calcium levels demand is increased leading to a reduction in the blood calcium levels. The principle behind the increased demand is the need for calcium in the milk production for the calves through the colostrum. The cows respond to the demand by generating calcium from reserves live the bones and the gut. Milk fever can be recognized by loss of appetite, weakness, nervousness which occurs in the first stage and can often go unnoticed. In the next stage the cow can be seen lying on flat tummy, the animal becomes dull with cold ears and dry nose and with trembling muscles causing difficulties in walking. Other symptoms can include low body temperature and an increased heartbeat with constipation and disturbed digestion. Other instances can lead to the animal unable to stand and progressive loss of consciousness. In a worse cause scenario, milk fever can cause death to the animals.",Do you know how to supplement calcium and other necessary nutrient in your feeding program?,

"How do I to choose a suitable breed of cow?

","When choosing the most suitable breed of cow, it is crucial not to risk buying an attractive cow that generates little milk. When selecting a good breed one should consider breeds that have a high genetic potential for milk for dairy breeds and meat for slaughter. While an outstanding cow may yield not much milk when not properly cared for, it nevertheless remains important to pick a cow breed with the right qualities for the conditions in which it will be reared. For a heifer, one should consult the past records of its lineage to make certain they select a cow with a track record of becoming pregnant effortlessly when inseminated, giving birth with no complications, and displaying calm behavior for easy care and milking. Considerably, such a cow must possess a good udder that is wide but sizably medium, not hanging loosely, and has spaced teats pointing down for easy milking and higher milk yields. It is additionally important to examine the breed's body shape and make sure it has an extended neck with a straight backline, strong straight legs, and feet that are spread out, ensuring it can graze and walk at ease, particularly when pregnant. Taller cows have good stature that will support good feed intake and digestions important in milk production.

"What to do if my cows are weak?

","If your cow is weak it is important to call a veterinarian for swift diagnosis and treatment. It is important to ensure that the cows are taken to a well sheltered and protected area and supplied with fresh and clean feed and water. Signs of weakness in cow can indicate a number of issues including injury or Nutritional Deficiencies. 
In case of injuries, weak cows are often targeted by predators. As such, owners need to be informed of such minor symptoms and ready to initiate swift intervention to improve their chances of survival. As soon as it is found that the cows are weak, the initial action is to roll them to a seated position and hold them with hay bales. Lying flat on the side may cause stomach bloating and nerve and muscle damage in the limbs, lowering the chances. The next action is to contact an animal veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. In the event the injury or illness seems irreversible, it must be established sooner to prevent suffering. Suppose the cow needs to be transferred to a different location; a cart should be used, and once moved, it should be offered fresh feed along with water continuously. These should be placed near the cow's head for quick access during her recovery and therapy.
In case of Nutritional Deficiencies, the veterinarian will advise on how to supplement the cows with the right medication and feed. During this time ensure that the cow is well fed, ensuring high quality food and water. Additionally, implement a diseases prevention program through vaccination and isolation to reduce spread of diseases to weak cows. ",Which feeds do you provide to your cows?,

"How do I manage water in rice cultivation?

","Water is important in rice cultivation for: photosynthesis; weed suppression; nutrient uptake; and cooling the plant the plant via when water is lost from the leaves. It is therefore important to maintain a balance between evapotranspiration and supply. Critical stages when water is required in large quantities in rice field are: 
After land preparation itâ€™s recommended to flood the field to facilitate puddling
Before transplanting it recommended to drain water from the field. However, after transplanting the seedling should be covered up to 80% of its height for a period of 3 to 7 days. This reduces transpiration and gives the plants a chance to re-establish their roots to be able to take up enough water from the soil
After seedlings establish, through to tillering, intermittent wetting is required 
From panicle initiation to heading: water level should be increased to 10 cm because pollen shed and fertilization requires humid conditions. Low moisture content (low relative humidity (RH%) in the air leads to poor pollination hence sterile spikelets
