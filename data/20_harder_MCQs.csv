What is the right procedure to harvest onions?,"Harvest during the dry season, at about 90-150 after planting depending on the variety. The crop must be mature by observing that the tops have started to yellow or droop, and the bulbs will have formed shing membranous cover around them. To harvest, loosen the soil around the plants to allow for easier removal. Pull the bulbs by hand or dig them up with garden fork. Once the bulbs are out of the ground, cut the tops back to about one inch. Clean the bulbs and let them dry in the sun to cure (dry out) before storing. If long storage is intended, cure the bulbs in a well-ventilated store by spreading on racks until the necks and outer scale leaves of the bulbs are thoroughly dried.|Harvest during the wet season, at about 90-150 after planting depending on the variety.

Last year I experienced significant losses in my stored maize grain. How do I handle my grain to minimize these losses?,"Harvest the crop when the leaves are dry. Thresh the grain either manually or mechanically but avoid seed breakage. Mix the grain with an insecticide (grain dust) at the recommended rate. Put the treated grain in gunny bags ready storage.
