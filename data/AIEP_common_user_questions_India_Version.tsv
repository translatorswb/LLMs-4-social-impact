Can the quantity of grain be increased in the absence of green fodder?  	Dear Farmer,  No, the quantity of grain cannot be directly increased in the absence of green fodder. Green fodder is crucial for livestock, particularly for animals that produce milk, as it provides essential nutrients and helps maintain their overall health and productivity.

A balanced approach that includes green fodder, dry fodder, and grains is crucial for optimal livestock health and productivity.

How to prepare a room to grow button mushrooms?  	Dear Farmer, there are two types of systems for growing button mushrooms   a) Tray system of cultivation  The compost shold be filled in trays leaving about 5 cm from the top. Different types are   1. Single layer spawning: The grain spawn is scattered uniformly all over the compost surface in a tray which is then covered with a thin layer of compost 200 g of spawn for 1 m² beds.  2. Double layer spawning: The trays are half filled and spawn is scattered. Then the tray is filled completely compost and spawn is applied as above and covered with a thin layer of spawn.  3.Through spawning/ mixed spawning: The required quantity of spawn is mixed with the compost and filled in trays or polybags  4.Spot spawning: The compost is filled in trays and holes of 2.5 to 5 cm deep are made with fingers about 8-12 cm apart in rows. About 5g of spawn if introduced into the cavities and covered with a thin layer of compost.  After spawning the beds should be covered with sterilized newspapers and water is sprinkled over the papers to maintain the moisture in the compost. The temperature should be around 25± 2° C with RH of 90 per cent. The spawn running will be completed in 15 days and it is ready for casing.  b) Bag system of cultivation  In this method polythene covers of size: 35”x24” with 150 gauge thickness are used. The spawn is mixed with the compost @ 500- 750 g/ 100 kg compost. Then mixed compost is filled in polythene bags @ 15-20 kg / bag. Finally, the beds are covered with newspaper.

How can I plant mushrooms?	Dear Farmer, to grow mushrooms, you'll need to create a suitable environment and introduce mushroom spawn (or spores) into a growing medium. The process involves preparing the medium, inoculating it with spawn, and maintaining optimal conditions for growth.  1. Choose a Suitable Space: Indoor cultivation: Mushrooms thrive in controlled environments, making indoor growing easier and more predictable.  Temperature and humidity: Most mushroom types prefer a specific temperature range (around 55-60°F) and a moderate level of humidity.  Darkness: Some mushrooms, like white button mushrooms, need darkness for optimal growth, while others can tolerate indirect light.   2. Select a Mushroom Type and Obtain Spawn/Spores:  Mushroom types: Popular choices include oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and white button mushrooms.  Spawn vs. Spores: Spawn is a more advanced stage of mushroom growth that already has mycelium (the fungal root system) and is easier to use than spores.  Obtaining spawn: You can purchase spawn from mushroom suppliers or grow your own from stems of oyster mushrooms.   3. Prepare the Growing Medium: Suitable substrates: Various materials can be used, including compost, straw, sawdust, wood chips, and even coffee grounds.  Preparation: Substrates may need to be sterilized or pasteurized to eliminate unwanted microorganisms.   4. Inoculate the Medium with Spawn/Spores:  Inoculation methods: This involves mixing the spawn/spores with the prepared medium. Spawn: You can evenly distribute spawn throughout the medium. Spores: Spores can be sprinkled on the medium.   5. Maintain Optimal Conditions: Temperature: Keep the medium at the optimal temperature for your chosen mushroom type.  Humidity: Maintain moisture in the growing medium without it being overly wet.  Air circulation: Ensure adequate airflow to prevent fungal diseases.   6. Harvest When Mushrooms are Ready: Fruiting: As the mycelium grows, it will produce primordia (small bumps) which will eventually develop into mature mushrooms. Harvest time: Harvest mushrooms when they are fully formed and before they release spores.   		
What diseases are caused by mushrooms?  	Dear farmer namasthe, some fungi cause human illness through poisoning, parasitic infections, and allergic reactions. Poisoning happens when people eat toxic fungi, they experience digestive problems, hallucinations, organ failure, and even death. Most cases of mushroom poisoning are due to mistaken identity. Candida are yeast that cause candidiasis, commonly called a “yeast infection” and Trichophyton fungi cause ringworm. Mold allergies are very common and caused by airborne mold spores.
