How do I, in the shortest duration and cost effectively correct for nutrient deficiency in my farm? 
1. Test soil for nutrient deficiency or perform visual observations of the crop to diagnose the deficiency; get the right source of fertilizer to replenish the deficiency; apply the right rate of the fertilizer that would sufficiently correct the deficiency; apply the fertilizer at the right stage of the crop to maximize uptake and use…remember to apply when soil is moist; place the fertilizer close to the plant root zone but not too close to avoid scotching
2. Test soil for nutrient deficiency or perform visual observations of the crop to diagnose the deficiency; apply well rotten manure; apply the right rate of the manure that would sufficiently correct the deficiency; apply the manure at the right stage of the crop to maximize uptake and use…remember to apply when soil is moist; place the manure close to the plant root zone but not too close to avoid scotching

What is the right procedure to harvest onions?
1. Harvest during the dry season, at about 90-150 after planting depending on the variety. The crop must be mature by observing that the tops have started to yellow or droop, and the bulbs will have formed shing membranous cover around them. To harvest, loosen the soil around the plants to allow for easier removal. Pull the bulbs by hand or dig them up with garden fork. Once the bulbs are out of the ground, cut the tops back to about one inch. Clean the bulbs and let them dry in the sun to cure (dry out) before storing. If long storage is intended, cure the bulbs in a well-ventilated store by spreading on racks until the necks and outer scale leaves of the bulbs are thoroughly dried.

Last year I experienced significant losses in my stored maize grain. How do I handle my grain to minimize these losses?
1. Harvest the crop when the leaves are dry. Thresh the grain either manually or mechanically but avoid seed breakage. Mix the grain with an insecticide (grain dust) at the recommended rate. Put the treated grain in gunny bags ready storage. Alternatively, you can put dry grain in hermetic without treating with insecticide. Clean the store, and dust it with insecticides before storing the bags. Ensure the store is well ventilated, and free from rodents, and stack the bags on pallets and in a way that ventilation is maximized. 
2. Harvest during the dry season, and importantly when maize is physiologically mature. Dry the harvested cobs under the until the moisture content is reduced to about 13%. You can estimate that the grain is dry by doing simple tests like salt test or biting test. Thresh the grain either manually or mechanically but avoid seed breakage. Mix the grain with an insecticide (grain dust) at the recommended rate. Put the treated grain in gunny bags ready storage. Alternatively, you can put dry grain in hermetic without treating with insecticide. Clean the store, and dust it with insecticides before storing the bags.
