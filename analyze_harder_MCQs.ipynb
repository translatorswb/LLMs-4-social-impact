         "Correct answer: A\n\nRationale: A follows the full “4R” nutrient-management principles—right source, rate, timing and placement—after first confirming the specific deficiency through a soil test or crop inspection, so nutrients reach the crop quickly and efficiently. Mineral fertilizers supply nutrients in readily available forms, giving the fastest correction. B relies on well-rotted manure whose nutrients are released slowly and unpredictably, so it is not the quickest remedy. C omits both diagnosis (soil test/visual check) and selection of the correct fertilizer source, increasing the risk of misapplication and extra cost. Therefore, only option A meets both the “shortest duration” and “cost-effective” requirements.",

         "Correct answer: A\n\nRationale: Harvesting onions is best done in dry weather; wet conditions at lifting greatly increase rotting during curing and storage. The crop should be lifted 90-150 days after planting when about 70-80 % of the tops have yellowed or fallen, indicating a mature bulb with a tight, shiny skin. The soil is first loosened, then bulbs are pulled or fork-lifted to avoid neck damage. After lifting, tops are trimmed to about 2–3 cm, loose soil is brushed off, and the bulbs are sun-dried for a few days and then cured in a well-ventilated, shaded store until necks and outer scales are papery. Option A contains all these key steps, whereas B recommends harvesting in the wet season (wrong), C omits the dry-season requirement and top-trimming, and D omits maturity indicators, so only A is completely correct.",

Both also recommend careful harvesting techniques and a crucial two-stage curing process: an initial drying period (sun curing), followed by extended curing in a well-ventilated store for long-term storage, aiming for thoroughly dried necks and outer scales.\n\nOption A outlines a more comprehensive and optimal procedure by specifying harvesting during the dry season, which is ideal for sun curing, and instructing to cut tops back to about one inch after harvest, promoting better neck drying and reducing storage rot.\n\nOption C, while omitting these explicit details, still presents a fundamentally correct approach. The instruction to \"dry in the sun to cure\" implies the necessity of dry weather conditions. Although it doesn't detail immediate top cutting, the stated goal of achieving thoroughly dried necks for long storage is critical and achievable if the curing process is managed effectively.

Option A details the complete IPM process: prevention through proper planting, regular monitoring, using cultural controls first, then biological/physical methods, and chemical controls only as a last resort. Option B correctly summarizes the key principles of monitoring, biological control, and limited chemical use. Options C and D are incorrect because they either miss essential IPM steps or present them in the wrong order - particularly, they don't emphasize that chemical controls should be used only as a last resort after other methods have been tried, which is a fundamental principle of IPM that's especially important for smallholder farmers in Kenya.",

         "Correct answer: B, C, D\n\nRationale: Cold weather in poultry farming creates conditions that favor certain diseases. Option B is correct because fowl cholera (bacterial disease) thrives in cold stress, coccidiosis worsens in damp, cold conditions, aspergillosis (fungal infection) increases with poor ventilation during cold weather, and respiratory distress is a common cold weather problem. Option C is correct as aspergillosis affects stressed birds, fowlpox spreads more in confined cold-weather housing, infectious coryza is a bacterial respiratory disease worsened by cold, and pneumonia is directly linked to cold conditions. Option D is also correct since pneumonia is a classic cold-weather disease, coccidiosis increases when birds crowd together in cold, and respiratory distress encompasses various breathing difficulties common during cold periods. All three options contain valid cold-weather poultry diseases that Kenyan farmers should monitor.",
